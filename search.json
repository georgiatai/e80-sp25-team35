    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this lab you will work as a team of four to use acoustic measurements to find the position of your robot in the test tank. The acoustic measurements will depend on listening to beacons at fixed locations in the tank, and guessing your position relative to them. Because there will be many beacon signals in the tank at once, you will need to use Fourier analysis to understand the behavior of the signals. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the power of underwater acoustic measurements and to force you to wrangle early and often with Fourier analysis.\nAfter successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:\n\nUse the FFT feature on the oscilloscope to interpret frequency domain signals.\nComment on how the FFT of a signal changes when signal frequency, sampling rate and total sampling time are changed.\nBuild a circuit interface to an electret microphone.\nUse the gain-bandwidth product of an op-amp to predict the achievable maximum gain.\nDescribe the effect of multipath on the amplitudes of acoustic measurements.\n\nThis is a rotation lab, so not all teams will be working on this lab in the same week. Odd numbered teams (11, 23, 35, etc.) will do this lab in week 6, while Even numbered teams (12, 24, 36, etc.) work on Lab 6.

    "text": "2 Introduction to the FFT\nThe oscilloscope ( Agilent/Keysight 2024A, spec sheet ) has a feature that allows it to display a live FFT of a signal on one of the channels. In this section we’re going to use that feature to study the basic behavior of the FFT and to examine the effect of windowing on real world data. The whole team should participate in this section, at minimum by watching. Much of this section can be predicted and analyzed very accurately in prelab with sample data generated in MATLAB.\nThe following signals are used in this section:\n\n11 kHz sine wave, amplitude 1.5 V, offset 0 V.\n12 kHz sine wave, amplitude 1.5 V, offset 0 V.\n11 kHz square wave, amplitude 1.5 V, offset 0 V.\n\nDo the following:\n\nConnect a function generator to an input channel of the oscilloscope.\nDouble check that your oscilloscope channel is DC coupled and using an appropriate 1x/10x setting.\nDrive signal 1 into the oscilloscope\nSet the time scale of the oscilloscope so that 50 cycles of the signal fit on the screen.\nUse the math function of the oscilloscope to display the FFT of the signal. Set the span of the FFT to 100 kHz, the center to 50 kHz, and the window to rectangular.\nCapture an oscilloscope trace for the current signal, and for each of the signals below.\n\nSignal 2\nSignal 3\nSignal 3 with the the “window” setting changed from rectangular to Hanning.\nSignal 3 with the time scale changed to shrink the horizontal time axis.\n\nCapture some oscilloscope data and take an FFT of it using Matlab, then compare that FFT to the scope FFTs.

    "section": "3 Circuit Interfaces to Microphones",
    "text": "3 Circuit Interfaces to Microphones\nYou will need to use microphones to pick up sounds in the tank. We will be using a waterproof electret microphone called the CME-1538-100LB.\n\nBuild the reference circuit from the datasheet for your electret microphone.\nVerify that you can receive signals with your electret microphone by clapping near it. You will need to set your scope to “Single” mode to capture your clap.\nUse the FFT functions to identify the frequencies in your hand clap signal.\n\nThe electret microphone output is small (generally 10s of mV depending on the sound) and zero centered, so you will need to amplify the tank signals to see them your oscilloscope. Designing an amplifier is trickier than you’d expect because of an op-amp parameter called the Gain-Bandwidth product.\n\nBuild an amplifier with a gain of 100 by cascading two stages that each have a gain of 10. Use dual-rail op-amps (like the TL081 or OP07).\nCalculate the bandwidth you expect out of each op-amp stage using the gain-bandwidth product of your op-amps.\nTest your amplifier using appropriate signals from the function generator.\nRecord your test results and your amplifier schematic in the submission sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapacitive Coupling\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reference circuit’s output is AC coupled, which means a capacitor is attached in series with the output. The capacitive coupling is why the microphone output is zero-centered. One way to understand the function of the coupling capacitor is by considering equivalent circuit models. The AC coupling capacitor and the loading from the oscilloscope combine to form a high pass filter. (Consider drawing a full circuit model to see that this is true.) This high pass filter DC signals while allowing high frequency signals to pass. Because DC has to be zero Volts at the filter output, the output signal has to be zero centered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhantom Power\n\n\n\n\n\nThe electret microphone only has two ports – they are listed as Term 1 and Term 2 in the reference circuit – but those ports have to achieve three functions: provide a ground reference, provide power, and provide output signal. Term 2 is used for ground, which is pretty normal. However, Term 1 is used for both power and output signal. Delivering power on the signal line is called “Phantom Power” in more sophisticated audio systems, and it works because power is delivered at DC while the audio signal resides at higher frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Amplifier Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to use dual-rail op-amps for this design because your input signal (the microphone output) is zero centered and your gain is high. It’s possible to build a pair of offset amplifiers that provide a gain of 100 and appropriate offsets, but dual rail op-amps simplify your design.\nIf your first amplifier stage is a non-inverting amplifier, then add a large resistor (~100k) between the positive amplifier input and ground. This resistor is necessary to prevent the input leakage current of your op-amp from changing your results. You don’t need this resistor if your first stage is an inverting amplifier.\nYou may need to solder leads to this electret microphone to plug it into your breadboard. You should consider twisting the leads together to form twisted pair wire. These wires do not need to be very long. In the tank room, you will be provided with water-proofed microphones with long leads so that you can dip the microphones into the tank while your circuits remain on the work tables."

    "section": "4 Distance Measurement Based On Amplitude",
    "text": "4 Distance Measurement Based On Amplitude\nOne way to locate your robot in the water is to listen to three acoustic beacons and calculate your distance to each of them based on the beacon power received at your robot. Three beacons are installed in the test tank and will be constantly emitting sine waves of approximately 9 kHz, 11 kHz and 13 kHz, and that setup is pictured in Figure 1. You will need to use the microphones in the tank room, which have long wires, to put a microphone into the tank and measure the signals coming out of these beacons. Analyzing microphone data with the FFT will be essential because the signals of all of the beacons are present in the tank at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Test tank with beacons and long microphones\n\n\n\nPrepare for your experiment by making models of what you expect to see\n\nFind an analytical expression that describes power at a distance from an acoustic emitter.\nYour measurements in the tank will be FFT magnitudes of Voltages received at your microphone. Convert your analytical expression from describing received power to describing your expected FFT magnitude.\nYou won’t have all the parameters for your analytical function (TX power, P-to-V conversion), but you can fit your model to your measured data anyway. Figure out how can you fit a function with unknown parameters to your measurements. Making some fake data in Matlab to test out your procedure may help.\nYou need to be sure that your measurements capture evidence of multipath in the tank, and achieving that will require careful spacing of your measurements. Figure out how closely you need to space your measurements in order to observe multipath.\n\nThen carry out measurements in the tank\n\nAttach a tank microphone to your amplifier from Section 3, and attach the amplifier output to an oscilloscope channel.\nUse your microphone, assisted by the oscilloscope FFT, to figure out which beacon corresponds to which frequency. The orientation of your microphone relative to the beacon can affect your measurement, so be sure to align the receive mic with the transmit speaker.\nFor each beacon, measure the received Voltage magnitude as you move your microphone away from the beacon. As a reminder, the spacing of your measurements is very important for spotting an important real-world phenomenon called multipath, and you’ll need to rely on your earlier calculations to figure out that spacing.\nMake three plots, one for each beacon, showing the analytical model of beacon power on the same axes as your measured points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe are using both benchtop electronics and water in this lab, and the two don’t mix, so BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL when putting anything in the water, removing anything from the water or mounting anything near the water. Instructors will stop your experiments if they think they pose a water hazard to equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThough this section shows that it’s possible to measure a robot’s position using power decay from a beacon, it’s much more common and reliable to measure a robot’s position using the time-of-flight of an acoustic pulse. See the time-of-flight reference design for more details on how to use time-of-flight measurements for sounding."

Turbidity is an interesting and useful measurement in oceanography, so this turbidity meter could be a stepping stone towards your final project. Further, the op-amp techniques that you use to construct this turbidity meter will be useful in any final project you select; the ability to buffer, shift and scale Voltages and currents is essential to many instruments. Extra credit sections offer the opportunity to explore other interesting marine sensors, and those sensors are also excellent candidates for final project sensors.\nAfter successful completion of this lab, you will be able to\n\nDesign and build an offset amplifier using an operational amplifier\nDesign and build a transimpedance amplifier using an operational amplifier\nDesign and build an oscillator using a 555 timer\nUnderstand the basic use of LEDs and photodiodes\nExplain clipping behavior in op-amps\nExplain how modulating a signal can help separate it from background signals\nExplain the basic theory of turbidity and turbidity measurements\nBuild and test a complex design by thoughtfully testing and assembling individual parts\nUse linear regression to extract slope, offset, and appropriate error measures from data\n\nThis lab will be carried out as sub-teams of two. Policies for sub-teams are discussed in lab 2.\nThis lab asks you to prepare solutions and handle chemicals. Though we aren’t working with anything hazardous (or which can’t be flushed down the drain), be sure to observe good chemical hygiene practices and use gloves and goggles when handling chemicals or sensitive equipment. Always use gloves when handling any glassware that will go into the turbidity meter.\nThere are a few resources used in this lab which must be shared. Please respect others and don’t abuse these resources. All the teams in lab are going to have to share a single turbidity meter and beaker of mystery solution. There will be three digital scales available. For Extra Credit 1, we have a limited supply of buffer solutions which must last for all our labs, so don’t pour out more than you need to cover your pH probes and be sure to use the smaller set of beakers."

The modified circuit will be an offset amplifier, which is one of the most common circuits in the final project.\nDo the following:\n\nUse an MCP601 to build a single-rail, non-inverting amplifier with a gain of two. Pay attention to the maximum allowed supply Voltage. Use a 5 V supply Voltage.\nApply a 100 mV amplitude sine wave with a 1 V offset to the amplifier input and observe the output. This output should match simple theoretical calculations well.\nApply a 100 mV amplitude sine wave with a 0 V offset to the amplifier input and observe the output. This output should have severe non-idealities related to the amplifier behavior. Identify the non-idealities, and explain why they are present in the output.\nDesign, build and test an offset amplifier that can take a 100mV amplitude sine wave with 0 V offset and produce an output with none of the non-idealities in step 3. Use a 5 V supply Voltage and aim for a gain of negative two (an inverting gain) and an appropriate offset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the MCP601?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are using the MCP601, MCP6002 and MCP6004 in this lab because they are single rail op-amps that are easy to power from a battery. That makes them particularly useful in the final project. You used a few dual rail op-amps in lab 2, and some final projects might demand dual rail op-amps for exacting measurements. For instance, extra credit 1 demands a TL081 for good reason. Talk to an instructor if you want to learn more about the difference between op-amps, which largely have to do with input impedances, output voltage ranges, and some properties that can affect uncertainty."

    "section": "3 555 Timer LED Driver",
    "text": "3 555 Timer LED Driver\nTurbidity is a measurement that depends on illuminating a water sample, then measuring the ratio of transmitted and 90° scattered light. We are going to use an infrared light-emitting diode (IR LED) called the IR1503 to illuminate our sample, and we are going to blink it on and off using a circuit called a 555 timer. Because IR radiation is invisible to the human eye, we need a sensor to tell if our system is working, and the OP950 IR photodiode serves that job well.\n\nBuild an astable 555 timer oscillator that has a frequency between 500 Hz and 1 kHz and a duty cycle of approximately 60%. If you use reference designs from the datasheet, omit RL from any circuit you build.\nVerify that your oscillator is working by measuring the oscillator output Voltage and the capacitor Voltage.\nAttach a series combination of a resistor and an IR1503 the output of the 555 timer. Select the resistor value and diode orientation such that you will drive 20-40 mA through the diode when the output is high. Selecting this resistor will require approximating the diode’s forward voltage (VF) at your desired current level, and information in the datasheet can help you figure out an appropriate VF.\nMeasure the Voltage across the resistor in the resistor-IR1503 combination while the 555 timer is operating. Check that this Voltage waveform implies that the correct current waveform is passing through the IR1503.\nBuild the switching time test circuit in the OP950 datasheet and use it to check that IR light is coming out of your IR1503. It’s easy to get the OP950 backwards or to pick an unsuitable resistor value, so play around a bit with flipping your OP950 polarity or trying a few different VR and RL values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Series Resistors on LEDs?\n\n\n\n\n\nLEDs, like all diodes, have an exponential relationship between the voltage applied across them and the current that passes through them. That means applying voltage carelessly can easily blow them up. We prevent such explosions by installing a resistor in series with our IR1503 when we use them. Note that you don’t have to calculate the exponential behavior of the diode because graphs and tables in the datasheet have all the information you need.\nThe OP950 has similar behavior, so hook it up in series with resistors when you’re testing it on its own. However, we usually use OP950s in transimpedance amplifiers (see Section 4), which protects them from careless overvoltage conditions.\nThis reference provides background information on LEDs and photodiodes."

    "section": "4 Transimpedance Amplifiers",
    "text": "4 Transimpedance Amplifiers\nWe will need to measure the amount of light that passes through a solution (either by transmission or 90° scattering) in our turbidity meter. The current through a photodiode is linear in irradiance (see the Light Current vs. Irradiance figure in the OP950 datasheet), so measuring the current passing through a photodiode is equivalent to making a linear measure of incident optical power. That’s great for us, but we don’t know how to measure currents yet. Fortunately, op-amps can help with this, but only if we build a new kind of circuit, called a transmipedance amplifier, which is pictured in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic for a transimpedance amplifier\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the transimpedance amplifier circuit to determine a formula that relates the diode current, ID, the feedback resistance, RF, and the output voltage, VOUT. Note that the diode acts like a current source pointing away from the op-amp when the photodiode is illuminated.\nBuild a transimpedance amplifier using the MCP6004 and an OP950. Configure unused op-amps as unity gain buffers with their inputs and outputs grounded.\nUse your LED light source from Section 3 to test the transimpedance amplifier. If you are seeing no signal, try flipping your OP950 around. Adjust the feedback resistor so you are seeing a large output signal.\nBuild and test a second copy of this op-amp circuit for use in your turbidity meter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransimpedance Deep Cuts\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Transimpedance amplifiers can be designed in many ways. The design we are recommending that you use is not the highest-speed design. High-speed designs will reverse bias the diode to reduce its junction capacitance (a type of parasitic capacitance found in all diodes) and add a capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor to filter out noise. However, applying the reverse bias makes current flow the other direction, which would require that the op-amp be dual rail or have an offset to ensure correct operation. This design is the simplest for a single-rail system, and it doesn’t lose performance when measuring large, slow signals like ours."

    "text": "5 Turbidity Measurements\nNow it is time to assemble and use the turbidity meter. You will prepare solutions of known turbidity using the TU-2016 calibrated laboratory turbidity meter, illuminate them with the LED from Section 3, then measure the transmitted and 90° scattered light using the transimpedance amplifiers from Section 4. Arranging all of these elements – the sample cuvette holding your solutions, the LEDs and the photodiodes – requires a little bit of mechanical finesse, so we provide a 3D printed fixture (instructions, Solidworks for base, Solidworks for cover) for holding the cuvette, LED and photodiodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou can Damage the Turbidity Meter\n\nDO NOT EVER OPEN THE CALIBRATION STANDARDS\nNever touch the glass of the turbidity testing containers with your bare fingers. Handling them with clean gloves is OK.\nBe sure to read the TU-2016 instruction manual to familiarize yourself with the operation of the meter before using it.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare a set of solutions of different turbidities using milk and water. Use cuvettes to hold your solutions. You should not need to fill the cuvettes more than 1/2 full. Eyedroppers or beakers may help you to add more precise volumes of milk to your solution.\nCheck the turbidities of your solutions using the TU-2016.\nAssemble your turbidity measurement setup. Note that you can connect your circuits to the measurement fixture in two ways: (1) solder long wires to the OP950s and IR1503 then connect those to a breadboard, or (2) place your measurement fixture directly on top of the breadboard and put the diode feet directly into breadboard rows.\nMeasure your solutions with your own turbidity measurement setup and record the peak-peak Voltages of your 90° and transmission transimpedance amplifier outputs.\nPlot the ratio of the 90° Vpp to the transmission Vpp against the calibrated turbidity of your solutions.\nAdd a line of best fit and appropriate uncertainty measurements.\nExamine the effect of ambient light on your measurements by shadowing your experimental setup while watching a transimpedance amplifier Voltage. Use your observation to justify why we switch our LED on and off with the 555 timer and why we care about peak-peak voltages instead of absolute voltages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurbidity and Nephelometry Background\n\n\n\n\n\nTurbidity is an optical measurement that is related to the total undissolved solids in the water. Turbidity is an important environmental monitor since undissolved solids can be indicative of eroded runoff, disturbance of the sea floor or other sources of particles.\nModern electronic measurements of turbidity are measured by shining light through a sample and measuring transmission — how much light passes directly through — and 90° scattering — how much light bounces off the particles to a sensor located at 90° relative to the light source.\nDevices which measure only 90° scattering are called nephelometers, and devices which measure the ratio of the 90° signal to the transmitted signal are called turbidity meters or turbidimeters. The relative effectiveness of the two devices depends on exactly how many solids are in the water.\nThis link has some additional information about turbidity, including a picture of some suspensions of different turbidity for visual reference."

You will let us know about your sub-team choices using a Canvas feature called “self-selected teams,” so give yourself a little extra time to turn in your submission sheet and sort that feature out."

    "text": "2 Logging Analog Data with the Teensy\nThe Teensy contains an analog to digital converter which can measure analog signals on many of its pins. In this section you will take your first analog measurement with the Teensy. You will use two different pieces of software to log data from the Teensy in this section: A program on your Teensy (written in Arduino code) will sample data, and a MATLAB program will interpret serial data sent by your Teensy. These programs sample the voltage on input A0, which is identified on the silk screen on the back of your motherboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAlways connect to your Teensy pins through the E80 motherboard, which has protection circuits designed to prevent damage to the Teensy.\n\n\nSet up the analog meaurement,\n\nAttach a wire to the empty A0 hole on your motherboard. Wire-wrapping solid core wire works well, a male-male jumper wire works OK. DO NOT SOLDER IT. We will solder a header there later, and desoldering a wire will make that more difficult.\nFind a way to make a connection between your motherboard ground to your signal generator ground.\n\nMeasure a first set of data\n\nConnect a 200 Hz, 1 Vpp, +0.4 V offset sinusoidal wave from a signal generator to the analog pin A0 and run the following sketch on your Teensy: matlab_logging.ino.\nWhile matlab_logging.ino is running and the Teensy is connected by USB, use matlablogging.m to receive a vector of data from the Teensy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerial communication debugging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to modify the matlablogging.m so that it points at the COM port which is correct for your Teensy.\nmatlablogging.m can’t access your COM port if the Arduino serial monitor is open, so be sure that it is closed.\nSometimes COM ports get stuck in unusual states and MATLAB can’t access them. Closing all of your programs will usually fix this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Apple Computers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe serial port (COM) can be found by going to Tools -&gt; Ports in the Arduino IDE or by calling ls /dev/ in the terminal and looking for a file of the form: /dev/tty.XYZABCDEF\nIn the matlab_logging.ino file, if you don’t see any output on the serial port, you may need to comment out the following two lines and re-upload the program to the Teensy\n\nwhile(!Serial.available()) {\nSerial.println(\"Waiting...\"); } \n\n\n\nAnswer the following questions about your first set of data,\n\nWhat is the sample rate achieved by matlab_logging.ino?\nWhat is the relation between the values recorded by matlab_logging.ino and the voltage applied to the pin? (i.e.: how many Volts is one “Teensy Unit”?)\n\nWhat happens to the value recorded by the Teensy when the Voltage on the Teensy pin is less than zero Volts?\n\nMeasure a second set of data,\n\nChange your input signal such that you are measuring a 175 kHz, 1 Vpp, +0.6 V offset signal.\nRecord data using matlab_logging.ino and maltablogging.m\n\nFinally, answer these questions about your second set of data\n\nWhat signal does your Teensy observe?\nWhy?

    "text": "3 Resistor Dividers and Instrument Loading\nThis section is designed to give you practice on two skills: accounting for instrument loading (i.e.: source and load impedance), and calculating uncertainties using error propagation. You will do this by predicting and measuring the Voltage at the output of a series of resistor dividers specified by Figure 1 and Table 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A voltage divider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Impedance values and measurement instruments for experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nZ1\nZ2\nMeasure With\n\n\n\n\nwire\nopen\nMultimeter\n\n\nwire\nopen\n1x Scope Probe\n\n\nwire\nopen\n10x Scope Probe\n\n\nwire\nopen\nTeensy\n\n\n10 \\(\\Omega\\)\n20 \\(\\Omega\\)\nMultimeter\n\n\n10 \\(\\Omega\\)\n20 \\(\\Omega\\)\nTeensy\n\n\n1 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n2 k\\(\\Omega\\)\nMultimeter\n\n\n1 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n2 k\\(\\Omega\\)\nTeensy\n\n\n100 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n200 k\\(\\Omega\\)\nMultimeter\n\n\n100 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n200 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n1x Scope Probe\n\n\n100 k\\(\\Omega\\)\n200 k\\(\\Omega\\)\nTeensy\n\n\n10 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n20 M\\(\\Omega\\)\nMultimeter\n\n\n10 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n20 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n1x Scope Probe\n\n\n10 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n20 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n10x Scope Probe\n\n\n10 M\\(\\Omega\\)\n20 M\\(\\Omega\\)\nTeensy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked to measure the output Voltage with the devices in the “Measure With” column, but some of the devices in the “Measure With” column may be unfamiliar to you. The devices are described below, and datasheet links are provided for each of them. To finish this section, you will need to read these datasheets to find the input impedance and the measurement uncertainty of each device.\n\n“Multimeter” refers to the multimeter chained to your desk. Our multimeters are the Greenlee DM-210A Digital Multimeter. Since the \\(V_{out}\\) node will very with time, you should be sure to measure it with your multimeter set to AC mode. The uncertainty listings for multimeters can use unusual units (e.g.: dgt and rdg), so don’t forget about this document on multimeter specifications that we also link on the lectures page.\n“1x scope probe” refers to using a BNC cable with hooks directly connected to an oscilloscope input. BNC cables don’t have datasheets worth reading for this lab because they’re just wires, so they have a low series impedance. However, the oscilloscope itself (an Agilent 2024A, which has this datasheet) has an input impedance and accuracy that you will need to look up. You can also create a 1x probe by using an oscilloscope probe with a switch set to 1x mode, and it will behave the same way as a BNC cable. When you are using a 1x probe, you must change the channel setting of the oscilloscope to be 1x. Note that some scopes call the channel setting 1:1 instead of 1x.\n“10x scope probe” refers to connecting a standard oscilloscope probe (set to 10x mode if there’s a switch) to an oscilloscope input. The gray scope probes in the lab are Keysight N2842A probes, and the black scope probes in 10x mode have a similar input impedance. Note that the input impedance of a scope probe is added in series with that of the oscilloscope itself, so the datasheet may report a total “terminated impedance” that includes the input impedance of the oscilloscope. When you are using a 10x probe, you must change the channel setting of the oscilloscope to be 10x. Note that some scopes call the channel setting 10:1 instead of 10x.\n“Teensy” refers to making an analog measurement with your Teensy. You made similar to the measurements in Section 2. You made some calculations of the uncertainty of the Teensy, which arises from the size of the Teensy unit, in Section 2, and you can find information about Teensy input impedance in the videos.\nThough this is not in the “Measure With” column, you will also need to find the output impedance and amplitude uncertainty of your signal generator. If you are using the scope-integrated WaveGen output, then you can infer the output impedance and find the uncertainty in the oscilloscope manual. If you are, unusually, using a stand-alone function generators (an HP33120A), you can find these values in the datasheet.\n\nDo the following\n\nFor the circuit shown in Figure 1, and for each of the values of Z1 and Z2 and the measuring instruments in Table 1, calculate the expected output voltages with confidence intervals accounting for uncertainty in both components and instruments. Assume the resistors are 5% resistors. Be sure to include the effects of instrument loading in your calculations. Note that these analytical calculations can be made during prelab.\n\nBuild several copies of the circuit in Figure 1, one for each pair of Z1/Z2 values in Table 1. These can all be built simultaneously on the same breadboard if you lay it out carefully. Please trim your resistor leads so that they lie flat on the breadboard.\nMeasure and record the value of each component used in your construction, then recalculate the output voltages using your measured component values.\nDrive the circuits using a signal generator and measure the output voltage with each of the instruments in the table.\nCheck whether or not the measured voltages lie within the predicted confidence intervals. Recall that you have two sets of predicted voltages, one based on nominal component values and one based on measured component values, so there are two sets of confidence intervals to check against. Also look at the percent error between the predictions and the measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are having difficulty with the 10 M\\(\\Omega\\) / 20 M\\(\\Omega\\) experiments, try pulling the resistors out of the breadboard and twisting them together in the air. Leakage currents in the breadboard can cause issues with that measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some common mistakes with lab equipment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are using a multimeter, think carefully about whether it should be set to measure an AC voltage or a DC voltage.\nBe sure to set the oscilloscope channel to match your probe. The scope channel should be 1x with a 1x probe and 10x with a 10x probe.\nFunction generators have a confusing setting called “OUT TERM”. Be sure it is set to “Hi-Z”, especially if you are seeing a factor-of-2 error in your measurements. (See the videos for an explanation of what this setting does.)\nMake sure all your equipment and circuits under test share the same ground. Be particularly careful with oscilloscope ground clips, which are connected to earth ground, so you can’t hook them up in the middle of a circuit. Measure differences with the scope by using two probes, not by putting the ground clip on a non-ground node."

In both cases, power the op-amp with ±15 V. Compare and contrast your results with equivalent cases (same Z1 & Z2, measured with multimeter) from Section 3. What is the function of the op-amp in each of these measurements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) An op-amp buffer connected to a low impedance divider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) An op-amp buffer connected to a high impedance divider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Op-amp buffers for divider experiments.\n\n\n\nBecause this is your first time building op-amps (look forward to many more in lab 3!), we provide this diagram that may help with wiring up your first OP07. Each of the connections on the diagram is labeled with the OP07 pin number. Don’t forget that pin numbers start in the upper left of the chip and wrap around it counter-clockwise. The capacitors, called decoupling capacitors, are important to include even if their purpose may seem unclear. See the callout note below for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An op-amp schematic showing all connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOp-amp breadboarding tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeatly laid out protoboards work better. Seriously, they do. They’re easier to troubleshoot as well. Please take the time to do it right.\nKeep your leads short and close to the board.\nStrip off the minimum amount of insulation to let your patch wire work; Don’t have big bare areas that can touch other things and short.\nTrim your resistors and capacitors to keep the components close to the boards. Don’t leave the leads long. Get the components down by the board.\nUse the long busses for power only. Do use them for power and ground. Don’t use them for signals. Use bypass capacitors (see below) on your power busses.\nTo the extent possible use coaxial cables to get signals on and off of your board. Put the input signals onto the board as close to the circuit inputs as possible. For example, use a coaxial cable with BNC connectors from the signal generator and then put spring-loaded mini-clips on the other end. Connect the mini clips to your circuit input and ground.\nIf you are using dual supplies for your op-amps, have three power busses: V+ connected to the +20 V output on your power supply, V– connected to the –20 V output on your power supply, and GND connected to the COM output on the power supply. You can adjust your supply voltage to be anything from ±1 V to ±15 V depending on what chips you are using.\nIf you are using a single supply for your op-amps, have two power busses: V+ connected to the +20 V output on your power supply, and GND connected to the COM output on the power supply. You can adjust your supply voltage to be anything from +1 V to +15 V depending on what chips you are using.\nColor code your wiring. A common practice is to use red for V+ power, black for V– power, green for ground, and white or blue for signal lines. If you have a rat’s nest of all red wires, neither the professors nor the proctors (nor you for that matter) will be able to figure out what goes where.\n\nYou may have noticed that the circuit has many capacitors connected to its power rails. These are called decoupling or bypass capacitors and they help to stabilize (in a feedback sense) the operational amplifier. The high gain of operational amplifiers can cause op-amps to interact with long power busses to cause oscillations. This manifests as intermittent, large noise in the output of the circuit. You can almost totally eliminate this issue by placing bypass capacitors between the power supply pins and ground as close as physically possible to each op-amp.\nStandard practice recommends both a 10 µF electrolytic capacitor and a 0.1 µF standard capacitor. For E80 you can get away with just the 0.1 µF standard capacitor. If you use electrolytic capacitors, remember that they are polar and if you put them in backwards they won’t work and may explode.\nFor dual supplies the capacitors run between V+ and ground, and V– and ground. For single-sided supplies, they run between V+ and ground. The circuit below shows a unity-gain buffer amp with dual power supplies and bypass capacitors."

    "section": "3 Motherboard Validation, IMU Calibration, and IMU Error Measurement",
    "text": "3 Motherboard Validation, IMU Calibration, and IMU Error Measurement\nYour motherboard has a circuit on it called an inertial measurement unit (IMU), specifically an LSM303AGRTR , which allows you to measure acceleration and magnetic fields. This is a useful sensor that we will explore more later in the course. We are just getting started with the sensor in this section by calibrating the output and measuring its noise statistics. This sensor is also useful because you can only measure its output if your motherboard is working correctly. The tests in this section will ensure that your Teensy can listen to the IMU, write to the SD card, and drive the motors.\nFirst, test your motherboard:\n\nSign out an SD card from an instructor.\nPut your Teensy and your SD card into your motherboard and program the Teensy with E80_Lab_01.ino from the E80 codebase from Github. This sketch will turn on one motor for four seconds if it is working properly, so be sure your motors are clear of any obstructions (especially your hands!) when you run the code.\nProvide power to the Teensy using either your battery or the power supply terminals (be careful with the polarity!). You can use the power supply terminals if your battery is still charging. Several lights should turn on, including PWR LED, the IMU LED, the SD LED, and a small blinking LED on top of the Teensy.\nYou have the option of plugging in your USB cable so you can use the serial monitor to watch the Teensy’s serial output as it runs.\nRemove power from your board (you do not need to remove the USB cable if it’s plugged in).\nTake out the SD card and put it into your computer.\nTake the INF and BIN files off of the SD card and read them according to the following instructions.\n\nThe Teensy creates two files to save data every time it runs: an INF file which contains text and a BIN file which contains your measured data in a binary format.\nSpecial programs are required to decode the binary data, and those programs also depend on having a matching INF file. We provide a MATLAB script for reading SD card data: logreader.m.\nThese links provide sample INF and sample BIN files so you can test the MATLAB scripts during prelab. The sample file is very noisy, so it can’t be used to find answers to the questions later in this Section.\n\nVerify that you are saving the following data to your SD card: acceleration values from your accelerometer, magnetic field strengths from your magnetometer, roll, pitch and yaw angles calculated from your IMU measurements, and motor PWM values.\nVerify that your motherboard can drive motors by attaching motors to motor ports A, B and C, then modifying and running E80_Lab_01.ino (which you set up in lab 0) to drive each of them. If your motors are not ready, you can measure the voltages at screw terminals A, B and C to observe whether they are being correctly applied by your software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease be very careful when connecting or disconnecting the micro USB cable to the Teensy!! Pull or push laterally while holding down the connector with your other hand. They are fragile and can be pulled off the board easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can put your Teensy into programmer mode manually by pressing the button on top of the Teensy. This button won’t restart a program currently running on the Teensy. Instead, it deletes all the code on the Teensy so it can be reprogrammed. If you just want to rerun your current program, remove power from the Teensy (maybe using the black power rocker switch) and then restore power.\n\n\nSecond, analyze the data from your accelerometer:\n\nLay your board flat on its standoffs, then take ten seconds of accelerometer data. Determine the mean, the standard deviation, the standard error, and the 95% confidence bounds for a static acceleration measurement in the z direction.\nFigure out the value the accelerometer reports when it is experiencing zero acceleration on each axis. You may need to run your program a few times while holding the board in different orientations to make each axis zero.\nUse the acceleration due to gravity to figure out the size of one ‘accelerometer unit’ in your saved data: i.e.: if your accelerometer reports a value of 1, how many m/s^2 of acceleration is the accelerometer experiencing? Note that accelerometers usually report an unusual unit called “milli-g”, thousandths of acceleration due to gravity, so you should expect one accelerometer unit to be some number of milli-g, which in turn you can represent as m/s^2. (Milli-g is abbreviated mg, confusingly.)\nUse the Student’s T Test to determine if the zero values on each of your axes are statistically different from one another."

This figure shows two important details about using penetrator bolts: the threads must point INTO the box and the washer must be OUTSIDE the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Penetrator bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Penetrator nut and gasket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Project box with penetrator bolt assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Project box and penetrator bolt details\n\n\n\nThese penetrators have six wires passing through them because your AUV will use three motors, which you must prepare.\n\nYou will need a total of 3 motors. If necessary, you can prep new motors as you did in E79, but your time will be very limited if you must build motors. Instructions can be found here.\nIf you have not done so during Lab 0, test your motors using a power supply to make sure they work by supplying 6VDC:\n\nIf the current draw during this test is more than 500 mA, then the friction in your motor is likely to severely limit your top speed; consider debugging it.\n\nSelecting motors that have similar current draws may simplify your software because the motors will exert similar thrusts at the same level of applied PWM.\nMake sure your motors still work when they are submerged in water.\n\nSolder the leads of your three motors. Your motors will be OUTSIDE of the box, so your solder joints will need to be waterproofed with heat shrink tuing. After putting heat shrink on your wires, solder the motor leads to the twisted pair on the non-threaded side of your penetrator bolt. Finish Waterproofing your solder joints with heat shrink tubing.\nTest that all three motors work when the waterproofed solder joints are underwater."

    "text": "5 AUV Assembly\nFirst, assemble your project box:\n\nFind your waterproof box and remove the protective paper tape on the rubber seal.\nDrill out your penetrator holes using a step drill bit. DO NOT USE A NORMAL DRILL BIT. Pictures of a step drill bit and the drilling process are in Figure 2 (a) and Figure 2 (b) . The inner diameter of your hole should be 0.5 inches.\nAttach your penetrator and motor assembly to the box (remember threads are in and washer is on the outside). This is pictured in Figure 2 (c)\nHold your box and penetrator combination underwater to check for leaks. DON’T perform this test with any electronics or batteries in the box.\nIf you find leaks, fix them before proceeding. Ask for help if you’re stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A step drill bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) How to use a step drill bit to drill a hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) An example penetrator installed in a project box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Information on drilling and assembling your project box.\n\n\n\nSecond, assemble your robot:\n\nDry your box and place your battery, motherboard and Teensy into the box. See Figure 3 (a).\nUse Velcro to attach the box to a PVC robot frame. Make sure to attach a plastic cargo mesh on the bottom of your frame for carrying payloads. See Figure 3 (b).\nUse zip ties to secure the cargo mesh to the robot frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A board and battery wired into a project box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A box velcroed to a frame with a cargo mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pictures of your board and robot assembly.\n\n\n\nThird, ballast your robot so that it is close to neutrally buoyant.\n\nDetermine how much mass to add. To do this, it helps to know the mass of your robot, and that the robot (including motors and two 1.25’’ foam blocks, but not including the watertight box) has a buoyancy force measured to be approximately 10 N. You can do this approximately in prelab with a guess at your robot’s mass.\nSelect weights for ballasting. Pictures of some of the weights we have available are in Figure 4 (a). Be mindful that their distribution inside of your payload box could affect the resting pitch, yaw or roll of the robot. It may be useful to adjust the resting buoyancy, pitch, yaw, and roll of your robot with the waterproof box before attempting the obstacle course in section 7.\nProtect against metal shorts. Many of the weights we use are metal, so they can short the back of your motherboard. Make sure the back of your motherboard is covered with insulating foam or electrical tape before setting it on top of your ballast. We also recommend wrapping your ballast in plastic wrap as shown in Figure 4 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Loose ballast in the corner of the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Ballast wrapped in insulating plastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reference images for finding and using ballast."

You must navigate your robot through the 3 hoops, starting at the surface in one hoop, diving through the second and surfacing in the third.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagram of obstacle course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Over water view of obstacle course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Underwater view of obstacle course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Project box and penetrator bolt details\n\n\n\n\nModify E80_Lab_01.ino to direct your robot to traverse the course so that it ends within the red hoop (3). You can assume your AUV can start in the middle of the yellow hoop (1). Make sure your code accounts for the time you will need to seal up the waterproof box, attach it to the robot frame, and position it in the water.\nBe sure to test your code with your robot ahead of time, in air and in a dunk tank, before you visit the test tank room. It is important to know how to control each motor, including which direction each motor turns. It is also important to verify that you are correctly logging data.\nGet your robot checked by an instructor, go to the tank room, and deploy your robot. You will only have 5 attempts in the test tank room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPart of the goal of this lab is to convince you that open loop control does not work very well. Robots navigating open loop can go off course because of motor behaviors, currents in the tank, misplacement in the launch area, or many other reasons. Closed loop control can address some of these issues. Don’t worry if your robot doesn’t complete the obstacle course."

Installing MATLAB on your personal computer\nThere is a version of MATLAB that youone can run in the cloud via a browser, but because we’ll be using MATLAB a lot in this class, so we recommend that you install it on your personal computer. To do so, follow these instructions. Please install MATLAB R2023b or later.\nImportant: When you are installing MATLAB, you’ll be asked what packages you want included. For E72, you need at minimum the following toolboxes:\n\nCurve Fitting Toolbox\nOptimization Toolbox\nSignal Processing Toolbox\nSymbolic Math Toolbox\n\nIf you’ve previously installed MATLAB, you can add the packages by going through the installation process again. To see what packages you have installed, type “ver” at the command window. You can also install packages within MATLAB by clicking on Apps, then Get More Apps, typing in the name of the toolbox in the search bar, and making sure Toolboxes and Products is checked under Filter by Type on the left side bar. If you get an error Your administrator has restricted your download access..., first try restarting MATLAB.\nThere are lots of videos on MATLAB online. For example, if you want to know how to use fsolve, you can search “MATLAB fsolve tutorial” on YouTube.\n\n\n2. MATLAB Onramp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of MATLAB Onramp\n\n\n\nFirst, you will learn some basics of MATLAB using the MATLAB Academy tutorial called Onramp. Note that Onramp does not require you to install MATLAB, since it uses an online programming environment that simulates MATLAB’s look, feel, and functionality.\n\nNavigate to the MATLAB Onramp self-paced online course. You will need to login using the account that you created earlier.\nComplete the following modules of Onramp:\n\nCourse Overview\nCommands\nVectors and Matrices\nArray Indexing and Modification\nData Import\n\n\nFeel free to explore other parts of this too to build your confidence with MATLAB.\nOnce you’ve finished the modules in the list above, take a screenshot of the Course modules pages which shows your progress and green checkmarks next to the segments you’ve completed. You’ll need to submit this screenshot for this assignment.\n\n\n3. MATLAB Plotting Video\nWatch this 17-minute video https://vimeo.com/57954461 to learn how to create various 2-D and 3-D graphs in MATLAB.\nWe strongly recommend that you don’t watch the videos passively. Instead, pause frequently while watching the video so that you can try things out on your own in MATLAB.\n\n\n4. MATLAB Debugging Tips\nWatch this 17-minute video https://vimeo.com/501103844 to learn how to find and fix errors in your MATLAB code. This skill will greatly aid you in all classes that require the use of MATLAB.\nIf you want to try using the debugger yourself with this piece of code, download debugpractice.m.\nTo download the file, you can click the little downward pointing arrow in the toolbard at the top right of the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Button to download individual file from the GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Practice Debugging in MATLAB\nPractice your MATLAB debugging skills on this script debugme.m, which is supposed to create a matrix like the one below.\nThe code should be able to produce a matrix with a user-specified number of columns. In the diagram below, we show what the output matrix should look like if it has 10 columns. The number of rows in this case would need to be 32, since the matrix has three 10x10 blocks in the middle, sandwiched by the row of ones at the top and row of ones at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Desired code output matrix.\n\n\n\n\nHint: In MATLAB, if you create a matrix with a certain size and then you try to assign an element of that matrix outside of its existing dimensions, MATLAB won’t give you an error. Instead, it will just extend the matrix outward as large as necessary to accommodate that new element."

    "text": "Analysis Week\nThough you are still free to work on your report and analysis in office hours and other E80 sections this week, you are required to attend your lab section. This is because we will do a few required activities, listed below, in lab. Some optional activities are available too.\nRequired: Fill out the end-of-semester evaluation – We are going to give you time in lab to fill out your end-of-semester course evaluations and the E80 post-survey. Note that participating in these evaluations is worth points on your final grade. Be sure to fill out an evaluation for your section professor. Odd numbered teams should also fill out a second evaluation for Prof. Spencer, and even numbered teams should also fill out a second evaluation for Prof. Brake.\nRequired: Have a writing conference with an instructor – You will also have a scheduled conference with an instructor where we will sit with your team to discuss our feedback on your Lab 6 tech memo. The goal of this meeting will be to share high-level feedback on what you did well and to suggest areas for improvement on your final report. A schedule of conference times and locations will be circulated via Discord.\nOptional: Work with your team on writing and producing slides – All of your team members are guaranteed to be available during your lab section, so this can be high value writing and discussion time. Teaching staff will also be available to answer questions about writing and data presentation.\nOptional: Conduct forensic experiments if needed – Experiments during analysis week are strictly limited, except for a very limited subset of measurements that we call “forensic experiments”. These experiments are allowed to help you figure out how a subsystem failed, or what you are seeing in your data. They are not intended to be additional deployments. Ask an instructor if you’re unsure whether your experiment should be allowed.\nExamples of good forensic experiments:\n\nA team needed to see how their measurements from an LED varied with angle to decipher their data, so they took their still functional sensor outside and waved it around to take that measurement.\nA team had inconsistent logging, so they turned their robot on and off with the box open and closed to prove that squeezing one particular wire caused the problem.\n\nExamples of experiments that we don’t want to see, which are outside the bounds of forensic experiments:\n\nDeploying your robot at pHake Lake.\nDeploying your robot in the test tank as a substitute deployment. Some very limited experiments may be OK (eg: to prove that you leak when you’re 1 m underwater), but an autonomous run to show your sensors working is not.\nBuilding or measuring new sensors; if it didn’t work, at least partially, during a deployment, then we’re not interested in seeing it in a final report."

    "text": "Recommended Outline\nBoth your presentation and your final report will be telling a similar story: why did you do a robot deployment, what are the technical details of how your robot worked, and what can the audience take away from that. Therefore, we expect that most reports (and presentations) will be organized as below.\nAll reports and presentations must contain the following:\n\nDescription of safety precautions that you took during your robot deployment to ensure that you gathered data in a way that protected the environment and other people.\n\nSuccessful reports and presentations usually include discussions of:\n\nScience and/or engineering goals\nSensors and mechanical modifications to achieve those goals\nDesign process and calculations\nPre-deployment modeling and expected measurements\nData processing\nComparisons between modeling and measured data\nInterpretation of these results\nRecommendations for future work\n\nThis content is typically organized as follows (note that the report will also need an abstract even though it is not listed here):\n\nIntroduction - Describe your scientific or engineering goals.\nSensor Design - for each sensor\n\nTheory of Input Quantity - What are the expected sensor input sizes (e.g.: temperature swings) from theory or historical data?\nSensor Selection - What sensors did you select? Why? Do they match expected behavior.\nCircuit Design - Show full schematics, calculations used to select components, and calculations showing that signals will be in range for the Teensy.\nSoftware Considerations - Is the 10 Hz default_robot.ino sampling rate fast enough? Did you write any additional code for the sensor?\nSensor Validation/Calibration - Show the sensor working in controlled conditions.\n\nRobot Design - Show mechanical calculations, sensor mounting designs, unusual details of waterproofing, and schematics for other circuits that haven’t been discussed yet (eg: regulators).\nDeployment Details - What steps were taken to prepare your robot for deployment? Where were the deployments (and what were the trajectories)? How did you account for safety in your deployments?\nResults - Include comparisons to theoretical models and ground truth measurements.\nConclusion - Provide a recap, recommendations for future work, interpretation of results, and a main takeaway for the audience.\n\nIt is possible to deviate from this outline if doing so would tell your robot’s story better, but this works well for almost all E80 deployments. Feel free to discuss such changes to the outline with instructors."

(e.g.: The audience is a group of professional engineers from different disciplines.) Every member of the team should participate in the presentation. Presentations will be graded using this rubric.\nYou should imagine the presentation is being given to employers or peers at a conference, which means that you should hold yourself to high standards of professionalism:\n\npractice until the presentation is smooth and well-polished,\nthink carefully about the story your visual aids are telling,\nensure that the visual aids are readable and high quality, and\ndress in traditional business or business casual clothing.\n\nThe questions during the Q&A portion of your presentation will come from both the general technical audience and your instructors. They will range from straightforward to very detailed. Be sure to prepare by practicing fielding pointed questions and by cultivating a comprehensive understanding of your work. Preparing supplementary slides which you can deploy for common questions can help you during the Q&A.\nThe presentation schedule is available here.

    "text": "Final Report\nEach team is responsible for submitting a report on their deployments in IEEE format. The report has a maximum length of ten pages including figures, references and appendices. Your purpose is to convey your experiments, your apparatus and your results such that a reader could replicate your experiment and compare their results to yours. You should assume your audience is made of technical professionals of diverse backgrounds (i.e.: not all instructors of the course) who are unfamiliar with your specific project. Note that this is a different audience than the presentation. This rubric will be used to grade the reports.\nHere are a few tips for good report writing:\n\nThe main body is often most digestible if it is written in several sections. Which sections are included and the ordering of your will depend on the specifics of the experiment, but some common, important topics are provided in the modified rubric.\nIf it is impossible to address every point in the modified rubric while staying inside the page limit then (1) make your writing more compact by using mathematical notation, tables or figures and (2) prioritize what is most important for your report.\nBe sure to follow the practices of scientific writing: use quantifiable descriptions instead of vague adjectives (“a 25% change” instead of a “a big change”), make sure all plots have labeled axes with units, make sure text in figures and tables is large enough to read, don’t use the first person (including cheats like “the team did X”) and minimize passive voice by making the experiment or artifact the subject of your sentences.\nMake sure to do some pre-writing to organize your text. Decide what topics you want in the report and where you want to put them before you start writing. Don’t talk about topics in the wrong sections or repeat yourself unnecessarily.\nDon’t forget that your writing style has a huge impact on how your work is received. Make a careful editing pass to be sure that each sentence says what you mean it to say. Then make a second editing pass for spelling, punctuation, common grammatical errors (especially tense mismatch, which is endemic), and gracefulness of language.\n\nHere are some examples of student reports.\nA rough draft of your final report is due at 5:00 PM on the last day of classes.\nThe final draft is due at at 11:59 PM the day before your final presentation."

    "text": "Breadboard Prototype\nThe first step in building a robot is building a breadboard prototype of all of your sensors. You should be able to start building this right away because this prototype should match the design from your proposal (though, of course, feel free to update and change things if you realize you made a mistake).\nYour goal is to do all of the following:\n\ndemonstrate your sensor circuits working on a breadboard, which you can verify with function generators and oscilloscopes. If necessary, write software to drive sensors (e.g.: time-of-flight sensors need special software). However, default_robot.ino logs analog values, and it should work for most projects without modification.\n\nstimulate your sensors with appropriate environmental quantities (temperature, salinity, etc.)\nrecord your environmentally stimulated sensor outputs on your Teensy.\n\nHere are specifications we are checking for in the live demo:\n\nPower from 12 V from the supply. Current should be reasonably low (a few hundred mA at most)\nEach sensor signal has appropriate stimulus that matches conditions at Dana Point\nOutput signal uses most of the range but stays between 0 V and 3.3 V (measured w/ oscilloscope)\nSensor(s) are in communication with the Teensy on the MTB and signal stays between 0 and 255.\nEverything but voltage regulators fit on one protoboard\nAppropriate software written if necessary\n\nThis step usually takes one week of the build. Try to demonstrate a working prototype to a professor at the end of the first build week. Be careful with your construction; building these circuits neatly helps with debugging this week, and with the transfer to your protoboard next week."

    "text": "Soldered PCB\nAfter you have tested all of your sensors and demonstrated that they work, you need to transfer them to the PCB that will go in your AUV.\nWe have designed PCBs called protoboards, pictured in Figure 1, and they are usually the easiest way to mount your components for use in your AUV. Protoboards are laid out like two halves of a breadboard side-by-side, so you can transfer your circuits from the breadboard prototype exactly onto them. They also have an area at the top for a 5 Volt regulator (the L7805 section). They connect to the motherboard as pictured in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A protoboard for the E80 final project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn isometric view of the protoboard connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA side view of the protoboard connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Views of the connection from the protoboard to the motherboard.\n\n\n\nSome helpful guidelines:\n\nSolder parts like the bypass capacitors and assorted resistors directly to the PCB.\nFor more complex parts, such as 16-pin DIP op-amps, solder a socket in place and mount the part in the socket so you can replace it if something goes wrong.\nBattery power available to your protoboard, but no regulated voltage supplies are available, so add voltage regulators if needed.\n\nThere are special areas on the protoboard layout for voltage regulators. See the L7805 section of Figure 1\nThe screw holes on all of the boards are grounded.\nGood wiring technique and tight layout will make your robot much more reliable and easier to debug.\nYou should use stranded wire whenever the wire will be subject to flexure or bending during use, disassembly or reassembly. It is much less likely to break under strain than solid core wire. As a general rule, when connecting two points on the protoboard use solid wire, when connecting to anything off board, use stranded wire.\nIf you are going to have connections to a penetrator bolt (more details below), it is helpful to be able to swap the penetrator bolt out if it breaks. Instead of soldering penetrator bolt wires to your Teensy, solder male-female jumper wires to your board so that you can attach the jumpers to the dangling wires from the penetrator bolt. (Though beware of wear cycles on the jumpers, it is possible to get a flaky connection out of them if you plug and unplug many times.)\n\nThis should be completed by week two of the build. Show your integrated robot to a professor and perform the same experiments that you used for the breadboard prototype to verify that your soldered board is working. There are three differences from the breadboard demonstration in the previous week:\n\nYou must use a soldered protoboard for the demonstration instead of a breadboard; every circuit should be fully assembled.\nYou must power your protoboard from a battery, not the supply,\nYou must take your logged data off of your SD card and plot it in Matlab for the professor. You can’t just show oscilloscope and serial outputs.\n\nBe ready to explain how you’re going to make adjustments on the day of deployment if you need to do on-site calibration, which is common for some sensors (e.g.: light intensity varies a lot between lab and the beach)."

    "text": "Mechanical Integration\nFinally, you need to assemble your frame, adjust your ballasting, build sensors and sensor harnesses, modify your waterproof box to admit your sensor cabling (and any additional cabling you need), and mount your electronics in your box.\nYou may need to make penetrator bolts for this project stage. A method for applying marine epoxy to bolts that have been drilled out can be found here. Remember that marine epoxy needs to dry overnight, so making these bolts requires two days because epoxy is applied twice. Be sure epoxy always dries in a fume hood: staff can show you an appropriate hood to use. We use 1/4” holes for our penetrator bolts and we hold the undrilled bolts in vises while drilling out the central hole. We find that six wires is about the maximum that we can fit into one bolt before the epoxy starts failing. You will also need to drill holes for these penetrator bolts in your project box. Be sure to use 1/2” step drill bits (which we have in our cupboards) to drill out the holes. Standard drill bits will result in ragged holes that are not watertight.\nAs you finish your assembly, here are a set of questions you may want to complete:\n\nDo you have all your sensors built and attached to appropriate lengths of stranded wire?\nDo you have mount points for your sensors on your frame?\nDo you have penetrator bolts built for all your cabling needs?\nIs your box waterproof with penetrator bolts in place? Conduct this test first by dunking in the E80 lab, then leaving it submerged for 30 minutes in the tank and checking for any moisture in the enclosure. (It can help to dry off the outside before opening it to make sure you’re not brining moisture with you.) DO NOT PUT YOUR MOTHERBOARD IN THE BOX FOR THIS TEST\nCan all your electronics and battery fit into the box?\nLeaving the motherboard disconnected from power and sealing hte battery leads with electrical tape, are you waterproof with electronics in the box?\nDoes your frame have appropriate holes so it floods with water?\nIs the combination of your frame and box neutrally buoyant? If not, how much ballast do you need?\nDo your motors have enough drive, and are their drive strengths close to one another?\nCan the sensors, motors and box be mounted securely to your frame? Even if you shake it a bit?\nCan you fully operate your robot in a dry test? With the electronics in the box, powered from the battery, can you get signals from your sensors logged to your SD card?\nWhat about in the tank?\n\nThis work should be done before the first deployment, which takes place roughly a week after your soldered demonstration. The sooner the better, it’s great to demonstrate mechanical integration and a soldered demonstration at the same time.\nYou don’t need to show your professors anything specific for this checkoff; we’ll see your waterproofing in action in the deployment"

We are going to structure the work like a lab from the first half of the class – there are videos, a quiz and a submission sheet – but the goal is to provide you the tools you need to start right away on your project. Specifically, we want you to leave this Jump Start with an autonomously controlled robot and a confident attitude towards understanding and modifying the robot code.\nThough this week’s activity looks like a lab. there are several crucial differences from a standard lab.\n\nThere will be no resubmissions allowed for lab 7 material. You’re done with this activity at the end of your lab session this week.\nConsequently, grading standards are going to be a little gentler for lab 7 materials.\nYou don’t have to do all parts of this lab. See more discussion below.\n\nIn this lab, every team is going to do some activities to learn about your robot software, then test out using IMU data to dead reckon a course, which is an echo of the work that you did in lab 1. After that, your team will select one of the following activities to pursue during this lab, each of which are designed to help prepare you for different types of projects:\n\nDiving Activity: In this activity you will build a pressure sensor and a P control loop for robot depth. You will test your loop in the tank. Pick this if you plan to have your robot dive or use a depth-controlled winch. It is possible that there will be a queue for the tank if many students in your section are doing the diving activity. Feel free to start on your robot build while you are waiting.\nSurface Navigation Activity: In this activity you will use GPS and your magnetometer to control the bearing of your robot, and you will test that navigation system by walking around with your robot outside of Parsons. Pick this if you plan to do surface navigation, if you intend to have your robot keep station (stay still), or if you plan to do a hybrid diving/surface navigation scheme.\n\nAfter successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the basic structure of the E80 robot code and be able to define vocabulary words used to describe that structure like: setup function, loop function, service, object, and library\nModify your robot’s serial output so you can inspect variables of your choice in your software\nAccurately discuss and calculate the effects of error accumulation on IMU dead reckoning\nUse a sensor appropriate to your chosen type of navigation: either the GPS and IMU or a pressure sensor\nModify and use the example robot code and the C++ libraries that we provide."

Modern best practices for doing so involve using Git for version control in conjunction with a web-based remote repository like Github. In this section (which can be completed entirely during prelab), your team will set up a shared repository so you can all work on the same code.\n\nAll team members should make a Github account.\n\nOptional: Consider applying for Student access, which unlocks advanced Github features while you’re a student.\nOne team member should\n\nRun a fetch and pull operation on the current E80 repository using Github Desktop (just to make sure you have the most up-to-date code).\nMake a new repository,\nInvite your team to the new repository.\nClone your new repository using Github Desktop web integration or typical clone commands.\nPopulate your new repository with all of your E80 code by copying and pasting it from your E80 repository folder to your new repository folder.\nCommit and push your copied and pasted code to the new repository.\n(Git savvy students will note that there are slicker ways to track both the E80 repository and your team’s work, for instance by forking the E80 repository. We’re doing this because it’s easy and we expect to push few software updates.)\n\nAll other team members should clone the new repository (see links above).\nAll team members should tell Arduino to look for sketches in the new repository by editing Settings -&gt; Sketchbook Location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe’ll be linking to specific files on the E80 Github repository below to talk about them, but remember that you downloaded all the Arduino and library files for this class in both your E80 repository and now in your team’s repository. So don’t download them again from the links, just edit the files in place on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Familiarize Yourself With the E80 Software\nRead this section and make the requested modification to your code. We recommend reading this section with your E80 software open in a code editor (VScode, Sublime, Notepad++, etc., NOT MS Word) so that you can look for features of the code as we discuss them. We also think every member of your team should do this section even though you’ll only turn in one submission sheet.\nThe E80 robot code appears in three files: E80_Lab_07_dive.ino, E80_Lab_07_surface.ino and Default_Robot.ino. We intend for you to use Default_Robot.ino on your final project, but you should modify E80_Lab_07_dive.ino and E80_Lab_07_surface.ino this week. (The dive and surface programs are simplified versions of Default_Robot.ino, so they’re easier to learn from.) Look at E80_Lab_07_dive.ino in this section.\nThe E80 robot code all has the .ino suffix, which means it is encoded in Arduino files (Language tutorials and reference), and as such these files have two extremely important functions: setup() and loop(). The setup() function is run once when your robot powers on, and then the robot runs the loop() function over and over until power is removed.\nThe loop() function contains several if statements that dispatch to functions. We call these functions “services”, and each represents one thing that the robot is doing. The functions used in many services are defined in libraries, which are described below.\nThe E80 robot code uses #include statements at the top to include functionality that is written in C++ (Language tutorials and reference), and we call each such C++ file a “library”. Libraries can be found in our libraries/main/ folder, and they usually consist of a C++ file (e.g.: SensorIMU.cpp) and a header file that the C++ file #includes (e.g.: SensorIMU.h). However, some library files only provide constant values, and therefore only have header files (e.g.: TimingOffsets.h or Pinouts.h). Usually we invoke a library function to in at the top of the .ino file to create a special variable called an “object”, and then we ask that object to use its functions to perform a service.\nWe can put these ideas together with an example: at line 150 a service called adc.updateSample() is called, and this service samples and records the Voltage on all of the analog pins. The if statement at line 148 guarantees that this functions is called exactly once per LOOP_PERIOD, which is a constant you can look up (or change!) in TimingOffsets.h. The adc object is created asa global variable on line 40. The adc creation code (the init() function) and the adc.updateSample() function are defined in the ADCSampler.cpp library, which depends on ADCSampler.h.\nTo put our new understanding to the test, we are going to edit the serial message that the robot displays each cycle.\n\nRun the E80_Lab_07_dive.ino code and look at the printed display by opening the serial monitor.\nModify SensorIMU.cpp so that the String returned by the printRollPitchHeading() function includes the X magnetometer value.\nModify E80_Lab_07_dive.ino so that it displays the output of the printState() function of ButtonSampler.cpp on line 2 of the message instead of the printStates() function of ErrorFlagSampler.cpp.\nRun the E80_Lab_07_dive.ino code again and look at the new printed display to see your changes. Note that your changed libraries should be automatically recompiled when you recompile your .ino file. Press the user button on the E80 motherboard to see the ButtonSampler.cpp library at work.\n\nFinally, look at TimingOffsets.h to figure out how often your main loop runs, which sets how quickly you sample data with the ADC, IMU, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou generally should not include calls to Serial.println() in your code, even though it’s standard practice for Arduino, because it messes with our printer object. The printer takes great pains to keep all the text easy to read as the robot spits out updates, and random print statements can cause it to jitter around. Use printer.printMessage() for one time messages (see DepthControl.cpp for an example) and printer.printValue() to print recurring values (as seen in the loop() function of the E80 code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBe sure to read the README in the libraries folder because it contains a lot of information about the features and adjustable knobs in each file. The adjustments described in the README file are sufficient to cover most standard student projects, so you might not even need to write code.\nFor instance, the README contains this important deep cut for the project: It is possible to increase the logging time of your robot by increasing the FILE_BLOCK_COUNT value in Logger.h. This can help you to log data during long deployments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.cpp vs. .h vs. .ino\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the code in this section highlights some of the interaction between the header (.h), library (.cpp), and Arduino (.ino) files. The header files are the interfaces, they hold information on variables that are used in other files and the functions of the library files of the same name. The library files are the implementations of the functions defined in the headers, and they use the variables held in the headers. The Arduino file sketch is the top level of the program, and it invokes library functions and header variables to implement the desired behavior of the robot.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Position Measurements via IMU\nIn this section we’ll use our board stack and our IMU to try to calculate position by integrating noisy acceleration data. As the lecture videos suggest, the noise is likely to make this position measurement fail. We’re hoping to see a concrete demonstration of that principle.\n\nPower your motherboard with a battery\nRun stock E80_Lab_07_dive.ino code without your modifications from last section, or run Default_Robot.ino if you don’t want to roll changes back. Make sure your IMU is producing sensible accelerations by turning it around in the air and, if need be, reviewing your lab 1 results.\nWith the data logger running, move your motherboard along a linear path in the horizontal x-y plane, keeping the orientation fixed. In other words, create your own global Cartesian coordinate frame on a table, set the position of the board stack to be (0 m,0 m,0 m), set the orientation of the board stack to be (0°, 0°, 0°). Then, move the board stack through the following positions: (0 m, 0 m, 0 m), (0.5 m, 0 m, 0 m), (0 m, 0 m, 0 m). Don’t move too fast, and note that it may help to wait 5 seconds at the (0.5 m, 0 m, 0 m) coordinate.\nUsing MATLAB, load the IMU data and calculate the position of the board stack as a function of time by integrating accelerations.\nPlot the x,y coordinates of the board stack and comment on whether the plotted path resembles the straight 0.5 meter path.\nPlot the y coordinates vs. time and include appropriate measures of uncertainty for integrated values."

    "text": "3 Diving Activity\nIn this activity, you will design a P control loop that interacts with a pressure sensor to control the robot’s depth. You will need to modify E80_Lab_07_dive.ino and the E80 C++ libraries to do so.\n\n3.1 Calibrate and Test a Pressure Sensor\nIn order to implement closed loop depth control with your AUV, it first needs to be able to sense its current depth, which we will do by interpreting a pressure sensor. You have two options to make your pressure sensor: build the pressure sensor from your project proposal on a breadboard, or use one of our pre-made pressure sensor adapter PCBs (picture, schematic, layout, KiCAD). We recommend building your own design to get a start on your project build, but feel free to use our PCB if you’re short on time. (Do note that our PCB uses a weird op-amp circuit that you’ll need to analyze on your own.)\nIn a deviation from previous practice, you will measure the operation of this sensor using your Teensy. By measuring your pressure directly in the Teensy, you can write code that interacts with your results in a direct way. We will take advantage of the serial data\n\nAttach your pressure sensor output to pin A0 on the Teensy.\nAdd a line showing your current pressure measurement to your robot’s serial report. Edit updateState() in ZStateEstimator.cpp by uncommenting the two lines of code below the calculation of the z position.\nRun E80_Lab_07_dive.ino. The pressure sensor Voltage should now appear in the serial monitor, and you will use that display to calibrate your pressure sensor.\nUse a graduated cylinder and a meter stick with pressure tubing attached to make a calibration curve with at least seven points between depth and Teensy-reported Voltage.\nModify depthCal_slope and depthCal_intercept in ZStateEstimator.h so your Teensy display reports the proper depth in meters.\n\n\n\n3.2 Write a P Control Algorithm for Depth\nAdd a Proportional depth control system to your robot by modifying the DepthControl.cpp file. Add the following steps:\n\nAssign the desired depth to a variable named depth_des. The desired depth can be found in the wayPoints array at the index currentWayPoint (i.e.: at wayPoints[currentWayPoint]).\nAssign the current depth to a variable depth. The current dept can be found in the state.z variable.\nCalculate the error, depth_error, as the difference between depth_des and depth. Pay attention to the order you subtract depth_des and depth, because a sign error here can make your P control push away from the desired waypoint.\nSet the vertical motor control effort, uV, to be the product of the control gain, Kp, and the error, depth_error. The default value of Kp is 0, so you need to change it in DepthControl.h. Kp=80 is usually pretty good, but tune it up or down if your motor is too weak or too strong.\nBound the vertical control effort between -200 and 200. These are empirical values that work well for most situations. Depending on your motor, you may need to go beyond these limits. You can go up to a maximum of +/- 250.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou usually need to declare variables in C++, but all the variables in these instructions have already been declared in DepthControl.h (go look for yourself), so you don’t need to declare them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails About the Code\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the library file named ZStateEstimator.cpp, in the function called ZStateEstimator::updateState(), you can see that the z position (depth) of the robot is calculated using the function’s input pressure_signal. The main loop() of the Arduino code is where z_state_estimator.updateState() is called. By reviewing this loop(), you can see that this pressure_signal input is receiving the output of analogRead(PRESSURE_PIN). analogRead() is an Arduino function that reads the value of a specified pin, and PRESSURE_PIN is a variable set in Pinouts.h, currently set to pin A0 (pin 14) of the Teensy. The pressure_signal input provides the pressure sensor signal in Teensy units. The ZStateEstimator::updateState() function then converts from Teensy units to Volts, then finally converts from Volts to depth [m] using the variables depthCal_slope and depthCal_intercept. This depth measurement is stored in state.z.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Test the P Control Algorithm\nTest your depth P control using the meter stick with tubing and the graduated cylinder.\n\nAttach the pressure tubing to your pressure sensor and run E80_Lab_07_dive.ino.\n\nWhile is running with the serial monitor open, insert the meter stick into the cylinder\nKeep an eye on the Depth_Des:, Depth:, and uV: values printed to the serial monitor.\n\nMake sure that the Depth is reporting a similar value to the current depth of the meter stick to confirm that your calibration works.\nWatch the control effort uV change as the difference between Depth and Depth_Des changes, making sure it behaves as expected for proportional control.\n\n\nImprove your P control test by adding a motor to your robot.\n\nGet an E79 umbilical (found in the lab room) and attach it to your robot.\nPut the motor in the vertical position, and use a ziptie to secure the tube to the frame.\nConnect the tubing to your pressure sensor and the motor wires to the Motor C port on your motherboard.\nRun E80_Lab_07.ino while the serial monitor is open.\nWatch the motor and the reported control values:\n\nThe motor should start spinning to get to the first waypoint at 0.5 meters. If the motor is spinning too fast for you to see what’s going on, you can reduce Kp.\nCheck if it’s rotating in the correct direction; if not, switch the wires on your motherboard (or change the order you subtracted the depth and depth_des to get the error in DepthControl.cpp, or change the sign of Kp).\nBlow in the pressure tubing and confirm that the depth changes, and that the motor responds to the change in depth.\n\n\nFinally, once everything is tested and working, deploy the robot in the tank.\n\nBring your robot to the tank room, run E80_Lab_07_dive.ino, and put the robot into the tank. Watch out for splashes onto your computer or motherboard as you put the robot in.\nLet the robot go to the two depth waypoints at 0.5 m and 1 m while keeping an eye on the values and messages printed to the serial monitor. Be sure to log your data.\nPlot the logged uV, depth and depth_des as a function of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe careful with the umbilical because it may not have enough slack for the robot to go down to 1 meter. If that’s the case, you can change the depth waypoints in the setup() function of E80_Lab_07.ino. If your robot’s motor is too strong or too weak, you may need to change your Kp in DepthControl.h.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can instruct the robot to stay at each depth waypoint for a specified amount of time by changing the diveDelay variable defined in the setup() function of E80_Lab_07.ino.. For example, setting diveDelay = 3000 will tell the robot to wait at each depth waypoint for 3 seconds before continuing."

    "text": "4 Surface Navigation Activity\nIn this activity, you will design a P control loop that interacts with a magnetometer and GPS sensor to control the robot’s angle. You will need to modify E80_Lab_07_surface.ino and the E80 C++ libraries to do so.\n\n4.1 Magnetometer Calibration\nA magnetometer measures the earth’s magnetic field, so it can be used as a compass to sense your robot’s heading. Read this article describing how it works. We have a magnetometer integrated into our IMU. Every magnetometer has errors in its measurement, which can be byproducts of manufacturing or of local magnetic disturbances (eg: the magnetic declination is -10.52° at Mudd). You need to calibrate those errors out before you can trust your magnetometer results. This article on magnetometer calibration is a good summary of the process.\n\nTake your robot outside, far from buildings, run E80_Lab_07_surface.ino, and log your magnetometer data while your robot is held upright and you slowly (over ~10s) rotate 360 degrees while standing in place. Save the logged data from this exercise for later.\nProgram your Teensy with our magnetic calibration software – Mag_Calibration.ino – and use Mag_Calibration.m to extract the hard and soft iron correction coefficients. You will need MATLAB version 2018b or later to run this code. Save the figure generated by Mag_Calibration.m to your submission sheet.\nUpdate the mag_offsets and mag_comp variables in SensorIMU.h with the hard and soft iron coefficients you just measured.\nRun E80_Lab_07_surface.ino and turn in a circle outside again. Also save these magnetometer readings.\nGenerate the following two plots:\n\nA scatter plot of mx vs. my where your calibrated and uncalibrated data are superimposed. Find appropriate units for the axes in Mag_Calibration.m.\nA plot of heading vs. time for both your calibrated and uncalibrated data.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 GPS Integration\nIntegrate the Adafruit Ultimate GPS into the motherboard\n\nSolder a 9x1 female header pin row onto the motherboard at the position labelled GPS (see Lab 1 for details).\nTry to find an assembled GPS. If you can’t find one, then solder male header pins to the BOTTOM of the GPS breakout board. Be sure to get the orientation correct; Figure 1 shows the correct orientation.\nUse screws, nuts, and standoffs to help secure the GPS breakout board to the motherboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A motherboard with a GPS attached. The GPS here doesn’t have standoffs in the left two holes, but you should add those on your board.\n\n\n\nGo outside the building and test your GPS Sensor integration by opening the serial monitor while E80_Lab_07_surface.ino is running. Make sure your battery is plugged into the motherboard because your GPS is powered off the battery (NOT off the USB connection that powers your Teensy). Make sure you achieve GPS lock and see &gt;4 satellites.\n\n\n4.3 Write Latitude and Longitude Software\nModify the library file XYStateEstimator.cpp so that it calculates the x,y position (in meters) of the board with respect to a Cartesian coordinate frame whose origin is at ( 34.106465°, -117.712488°). Consult the XYStateEstimator.h file to see what variables you have available. Design your coordinate frame so the X axis points due East and the Y axis points due North. The code to make this transformation should be placed in the function named updateState() in XYStateEstimator.cpp, and the calculated positions will be stored in the variables state.x and state.y. To do this, we will use a modified version of the Forward Equirectangular Projection, where we multiply use the radius of curvature R_earth to scale latitude and longitude angles in order to calculate arc lengths on the Earth’s surface. This conversion assumes that the earth is a sphere (which it is to within ±0.25%).\nWhile we’re here, we have a little work to do to calculate yaw correctly. In this class we are using east-north-up local tangent plane coordinates. This means that you need to convert the heading from the IMU, which should have 0 degrees due North and positive angle in the CW direction, to yaw angles where 0 degrees points in the positive X direction (due East), and positive angles are in the CCW direction. If 0 degrees doesn’t face perfectly East, (which is location dependent due to abnormalities in the Earth’s magnetic field), you can add an offset angle to ensure it does. Put code to make this conversion in XYStateEstimator.cpp in the updateState() function. Store the result in state.yaw.\n\nTo calculate state.y, use the relationship between the distance along an arc’s edge, the radius of the arc, and the angle, (e.g. state.y = R_earth*latitudeChange).\nTo calculate state.x, note that it is a function of latitude, (e.g. state.x=R_earth*longitudeChange*cos(latitude at origin)).\nTo calculate state.yaw, add an appropriate offset to state.heading and, if necessary, multiply some part of your expression by -1 to flip around a sign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude and Longitude Background\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may help to first make sure you are aware of how longitude and latitude work. This link is helpful and has a nice image to help visualize the coordinate system. There are several algorithms that have been used to convert longitude-latitude coordinates to x-y coordinates. There is the Vincenty formula, the Haversine equation, and linear transformations that simply scale the coordinates. The first two methods incorporate the curvature of the earth which is important when the vehicle is traveling many kilometers. Scaling methods are easier, but can only be used if distances are short. A good reference can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou usually need to declare variables in C++, but all the variables in these instructions have already been declared in XYStateEstimator.h (go look for yourself), so you don’t need to declare them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe most common programming mistakes that we see are messing up units (is this angle in degrees or radians?), and failing to re-map angles between -\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\) after they are calculated. Letting an angle be \\(3\\pi/2\\) will crash a lot of your code unless you’re very careful.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Position Measurements via GPS\nTo test that your sketch is functioning well, log the x,y positions (they are logged by default in the sample code) as you walk from the coordinate system origin to Foothill Blvd.\n\nRun E80_Lab_07_surface.ino outside and ensure that you achieve GPS lock and are logging reasonable GPS data. It takes time (sometimes a few minutes) before the GPS receiver gets a lock on the signals from the satellites. The GPS lock LED can help you identify if your board has achieved lock.\nWalk the following path\n\nStart at the origin defined above\nWalk along the sidewalk East towards Shanahan.\nWalk South between Shanahan and Parsons.\nCut West back to Parson’s building and end at the origin.\nThe path is illustrated in Figure 2. You may want to have the serial monitor open (and print x,y to the screen) when walking the course. This will inform you if your conversion makes sense.\n\n\nUsing MATLAB, plot the logged x,y positions from the path. Only plot the x,y points for which the GPS has a lock on satellites. Overlay these points on an image of campus using the imread and image Matlab commands in addition to normal plotting functions. The hold on command may help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A path to walk to test the GPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Proportional Surface Control\nIn this section you will implement a Proportional surface control system with your AUV using the GPS on your motherboard. Use E80_Lab_07_surface.ino as the starter code for this portion. You will also interact with two new library files: SurfaceControl.cpp and SurfaceControl.h.\nAdd a Proportional surface control system to your robot by modifying the SurfaceControl.cpp file. Add the following steps:\n\nConfirm that you can compile and upload the starter code to your Teensy before you make any changes.\nCalculate the desired yaw angle using the atan2 function. i.e. yaw_des = atan2(y_des - y, x_des - x). In this case, (x_des, y_des) is the desired position of the robot.\nCalculate the error, yaw_error, as the difference between yaw_des and yaw. (Which you just calculated based on state.heading above).\nSet the control effort, u, to be a product of the control gain, Kp, and the error, yaw_error.\nSet the right and left motor thruster values (uR and uL) to be the avgPower + u and avgPower - u respectively.\nModify SurfaceControl.h to set avgPower to be 50 by default. This can be modified later if you want your robot to have faster or slower forward motion.\nMultiply uR and uL by Kr and Kl respectively, (e.g. uR = uR*Kr;) to give you a way to account for uneven motors. The default values for Kr and Kl are 1.0, but you can change them later if your motors don’t run at the same speed when given the same PWM signal.\nBound the uR and uL control values to be between 0 and 127.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs above, the header file (in this case, SurfaceControl.h) takes care of variable declarations for you.\n\n\nTest your P control by walking the campus while trying to obey the commands given by uR and uL.\n\nMake sure the path defined is in the code to be the three x,y coordinates (125,-40), (150,-40), (125,-40). This should walk you 25 meters along the centerline of campus (see Figure 3).\nGo to the origin.\nWalk at a slow speed, turning in response to the u_R and u_L values printed to the Serial monitor. If the the values are uR=45 and uL = 55, then veer right to try to equalize uR and uL. Be sure to save your logged data.\n\nPlot the logged path of x, y points on top of an image of campus. Also plot the angle error and control effort u as a function of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A path to walk to test GPS-based P control of robot angle.\n\n\n\nFinally, if you have time, attach motors to the Motor A and Motor B port and repeat the above experiment, this time obeying your observations of the motor’s rotation rates rather than the printed u_R and u_L values. Modify Kr and Kl if necessary to balance your motors. Pay special attention to how motors affect your yaw measurement: they give off powerful magnetic fields that are likely to interfere with your experiment if you don’t handle them with care. No plots are required for this extra activity, but it can give you insight into how your robot will perform during the project deployments."

We recommend a LC low-pass filter here because it’s a second order filter instead of a first order filter. This design has well-controlled frequency (see lab 3 for setting the 555 frequency), and it’s easy to control its amplitude (by setting VCC, perhaps with a voltage regulator). However, it doesn’t produce pure sine waves, it’s sometimes tricky to control its offset, and it’s very susceptible to power supply inductance: bypassing and careful layout are important to avoid intermittent errors with this design."

Considering the max detector circuit as an example: the capacitor can charge quickly through the diode, but only discharges slowly through the resistor. This means the circuit will hold maxima of the input waveform. This behavior is particularly effective when the input is periodic because the input will refresh the charge on the capacitance each period, reducing the effect of the slow RC decay in the output. The RC discharge allows the detector to be updated if the amplitude of the input sinusoid changes. Select the RC time constant to be larger than the input period and smaller than the period of changes in your amplitude.\nThe op-amp serves to match the voltage on the capacitor to the input voltage, effectively hiding the typical 0.7 V drop across the diode. However, this has the effect of limiting the maximum or minimum output: in the case of the max detector, the capacitor output can’t go higher than 0.7V below the op-amp maximum output."

The gain here is \\(-R_f/R_i\\) as usual, with the wrinkle that \\(R_f\\) is made up of some combination of \\(R_{f1}\\) and \\(R_{f2}\\). The Teensy pin controls a switch that puts \\(R_{f2}\\) in parallel with \\(R_{f1}\\), and thereby changes the total effective \\(R_f\\). You can achieve more gain control with more parallel feedback branches.\nThe switch is drawn as a N-type MOSFET, and that will work well for most final projects. However, there are some subtleties to selecting a transistor switch like this, and you can talk to a professor if your think your switch is acting strangely.\nIt’s also possible to simplify this design by replacing the transistor switch with a jumper that you manually install before deploying. Doing so will let you tune your gain to specific values by adding and removing jumpers, which doesn’t require soldering. This is particularly handy if you need to trim your gain during deployment. However, doing this presents other potential challenges: be sure to record your jumper configuration for each deployment, and make sure your jumpers aren’t mechanically sensitive. Extending this idea, you can simplify even further by replacing eliminating the \\(R_{f2}\\) path and replacing \\(R_{f1}\\) with a potentiometer (a variable resistor), but doing so poses significant deployment challenges since you need to measure your potentiometer value before each deployment."

    "section": "Salinity Sensor",
    "text": "Salinity Sensor\nSalinity is a measure of the total dissolved salt content of water. It is an extremely important and common measurement in oceanographic studies. Salinity measurements are used to track the flow of water and map the hydrological cycle, calibrate acoustic communication links, and understand biological phenomena like algal blooms.\nYou measure salinity by measuring salt water’s conductivity, then backing out the salt concentration that would result in that conductivity. Some online calculators can help with this process. This converts from a measured conductivity to salinity, and this converts from salinity to conductivity. Note that both converters depend on water temperature, so you’ll probably need to deploy a temperature probe at the same time. Here’s an example of some measurements performed by E80 staff that show the temperature effects.\nSalt, water and electrons will undergo chemical reactions at the surface of your salinity probe that can deposit metal salts on your electrodes. These salts can form non-conductive films that corrupt your conductivity measurements. You can prevent salt buildup by reversing the surface reactions, so applying an AC voltage to your probe prevents buildup over time. This same chemistry can also cause your circuit to fail if the electrode area is too small or the voltage applied to the solution is too low. We also recommend stainless steel as your probe material. Stainless steel wire can help too because salt water readily corrodes copper.\nWith these considerations, we recommend the following circuit to measure salinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A salinity sensor\n\n\n\nThis circuit consists of an oscillator, which can be implemented as a phase shift oscillator, a 555 oscillator, or another oscillator of your choice, an offset amplifier gain stage, a max detector and a min detector. Each of these components has a purpose\n\nThe oscillator stimulates the probe with an alternating Voltage to prevent buildup of metal salts. You need to pick the frequency to get the best possible measurement, which is complicated because the probe equivalent circuit is a resistor in parallel with a capacitor. You may want to read this reference for further information. The exact R and C of your probe depend on probe construction, notably because the separation of probes is a key component of calculating both resistance and capacitance.\nThe positive input of the op-amp is set to mid rail in order to pin the negative input at the same voltage, which also helps prevent metal salt buildup. The voltage across the probe is set by the difference between the oscillator voltage and the negative input, and setting the negative input to mid-rail guarantees zero DC voltage on the probe because oscillators usually oscillate above and below mid-rail.\nThe offset amplifier scales and shifts the oscillator output. Select RF to achieve your desired output amplitude. The output amplitude is directly proportional to probe conductivity because the gain is \\(-R_f/R_i = -R_f \\cdot G_{probe}\\). Picking RF will require you to know the conductivity of the solutions you’ll test in, fortunately there are many references that can help you find the expected salinity and conductivity of the ocean.\nMeasuring amplitude of an oscillating signal is hard with the Teensy because of its slow sampling rate. The max and min detectors make it possible for the Teensy pins on the far right to pick off amplitude without any risk of sampling in the middle of the sine wave.\n\nCalibration curves for salinity sensors are typically log-log plots of output Voltage vs. input concentration."

    "text": "PH Sensor and Interface Circuit\npH needs no introduction, but in oceanography it can be an important indicator of acidic runoff from the surface. The pH of the water also has a strong impact on the health of various plant and animal species, notably coral. You will build a circuit to interact with a pH sensor and calibrate it against buffer solutions.\nWe stock a small number of Pasco pH electrodes for pH measurements. These electrodes are usually used with interface boxes provided by Pasco (the Pasport system), but you can hook circuits directly to the BNC connector of the pH probe.\nThe pH probes are delicate instruments, so be sure to always re-cap them in a bath of pH 7 buffer solution and never leave them sitting exposed to air. Rinse them in a bath of deionized water and shake off any excess droplets before returning them to buffer solution. Buffer solutions are relatively expensive chemicals, so use them thoughtfully: Use the smaller 50mL beakers to hold buffer solutions at your station and take pains not to spill any buffer solution when pouring it from the main supply. Buffer solutions may be rinsed down the sink when you are done with them.\nThe probes need special care to make repeatable and accurate measurements, so a few experimental tips will help you to get consistent results when taking calibration measurements. We stock pH 4, 7 and 10 precursor powders that can be used to make solutions of different pH. When you measure the pH of those solutions, stir the probes gently when you first immerse them, and be sure to wait for the probe voltage to stabilize when taking a measurement because their time constants are long. Finally, keep your hands away from the probes during measurement because the unshielded connections are sensitive to noise that can couple in through your body. Motor currents can couple through seawater to mess up this measurement too.\nThis application note has a ballpark estimate for the output impedance of a pH probe, which is very high (order 1 G\\(\\Omega\\)). This reference is a handy guide to the operation of pH sensors. The pH sensor guide explains that ions diffusing through glass, a slow process, provide the output current from a pH sensor, which explains why the output impedance for this sensor is so high.\nYou can amplify the voltage out of these probes using an MCP601 configured as a non-inverting amplifier. You must use a non-inverting amplifier because inverting amplifiers and offset amplifiers have input impedances that will react poorly with the probe’s very large output impedance; inverting amplifiers and offset amplifiers dangle the \\(R_i\\) resistor off of the output node of the pH probe. (We also like the TL081 for this circuit because it has even higher input impedance than the MCP601, but putting a dual rail op-amp on your robot is deeply tedious work.)"

    "section": "Thermocouple Interface Circuit",
    "text": "Thermocouple Interface Circuit\nThermocouples generate very small voltages, so the Voltages must be amplified to be read by the Teensy. The easiest way to do the amplification is with an instrumentation amplifier. The one we have available is the Analog Devices AD623ANZ (data sheet here).\nPay special attention to the AD623 voltage supply range. It can operate with a dual rail supply Voltage of ±2.5 V to ±6 V, or it can operate with a single rail supply voltage from 0V to 5-12V. If you exceed the voltage supply range, you will destroy the chip. The op-amp standard of ±15 V will destroy it immediately. Don’t be tempted.\nFigure 79 in the AD623 data sheet shows the basic circuit for connecting a thermocouple. Note that in Figure 79, the amplifier is powered with a dual rail supply. You should use a single rail supply because your AUV will be powered by a battery. However, when you use a single rail you must also offset your thermocouple Volage to mid-rail (e.g., if you supply with 0-to-5 V, your thermocouple should be offset to 2.5 V). The circuit shown below in Figure 6 will accomplish that offset. Note that the offset uses a unity-gain, non-inverting op-amp to provide a low output impedance for the offset voltage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Schematic for AD623 thermocouple circuit.\n\n\n\nYou’ll need a thermocouple to test this amplifier, and we have spare type-E thermocouple wire available (specifically, Omega FF-E-24-SLE-200). The simplest way to construct a thermocouple for this task is to use one of the recycled ones. Otherwise, take a 1-foot length of thermocouple wire, strip the wires at one end and twist them firmly together so they make electrical contact. DO NOT USE SOLDER. It will not stick to the wires.\nYou’ll also need cold junction compensation. We recommend using a solid-state linear sensor (because temperature inside your robot should be pretty constant). You’ll need ot keep the solid-state linear sensor and the cold junction in good thermal contact, and a block of metal can provide a thermally conductive platform to mount your sensors.\nThe AD623 is expensive ($7/chip), so return undamaged chips to stock."

    "section": "Acoustic Time-of-flight Distance Measurements",
    "text": "Acoustic Time-of-flight Distance Measurements\nYou can measure the distance between a speaker and an object by launching a pulse of sound then measuring how long it takes to receive an echo. This is called a time-of-flight (ToF) measurement. Implementing ToF on a robot requires a transmit (TX) circuit, a receive (RX) circuit and some special software.\nFor TX, we recommend using the LM384 audio amplifier to drive the DAEX25W-8 speaker. The “Typical 5 W Amplifier” reference circuit in the LM384 datasheet is a good design for our purposes, though we can make a few small changes to improve it by omitting the volume control potentiometer and adding some bypass and coupling capacitors. These changes are illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Acoustic time-of-flight transmit circuit.\n\n\n\nIf you want to simplify your Teensy code, you can drive this circuit with a 555 timer instead of the Teensy. If you do so, note that you can easily turn your timer on and off, and therefore turn your speaker on and off, by controlling the 555 reset pin with a Teensy output pin. Adding a pull-down resistor between the 555 reset pin and ground can prevent annoying squawks while the Teensy starts up.\nFor RX, you will need to build an amplifier. There are several possible strategies for this amplifier, and we recommend one of the simplest here: we recommend using only non-inverting amplifiers. Doing so will deliberately cause your zero-centered microphone signal to clip, so we are throwing away possible signal power in favor of a simple implementation. However, we only care about the presence/absence of a signal, so clipping isn’t a problem if we can muster enough gain. Depending on the range you’re working at, you may need a gain as high as 10,000, but we’ve seen OK results with gains in the 100-1000 range. You will need to split this gain across several stages to avoid running afoul of your op-amp’s gain-bandwidth product.\nTwo extra circuits in the receive chain can simplify your analysis work. A filter tuned to your transmit freuqency will prevent your very-high-gain amplifier from picking up ocean noise (e.g.: boat propellors). A second-order, band-pass Sallen-Key filter has worked in the past, and so has a cascade of op-amp low-pass and high-pass filters. Finally, a max detector at the end of your receive chain reduces the required sampling rate on the Teensy.\nThese recommendations are combined in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Acoustic time-of-flight receive circuit.\n\n\n\nFor software, you will need to increase the sampling rate of the Teensy. You can do so using the BurstADCSampler library provided in our default Github package. Invoking BurstADCSampler by calling burst_adc.sampler() in the main Default_Robot.ino will cause the ADC to rapidly sample data (at about 7.4 kHz) and save that burst data to a separate file. You need to disable analog read averaging to use the BurstADCSampler, and you do that by adding the following line to your Default_Robot.ino setup function:\nvoid setup() {\n    analogReadAveraging(0);\n    ... \n    EXISTING SETUP CODE \n    ...\n}\nIf you are trying to drive your speaker pin directly instead of using a 555 timer, you will need to use the Teensy’s analogWrite functionality. Do so by editing Pinouts.h to set SPEAKER_PIN to your speaker output pin number. Then add the lines below to your setup function, and trigger a write by running analogWrite(SPEAKER_PIN, 0) in Default_Robot.ino.\nvoid setup() {\n    pinMode(SPEAKER_PIN, OUTPUT);\n    // set frequency to 3 kHz, change for your application\n    analogWriteFrequency(SPEAKER_PIN, 3000); \n    ...\n    EXISTING SETUP CODE\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-Lab Audio Tests\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Testing, it’s handy to be able to test your circuit from a function generator without getting all the Teensy code working. The old function generators (the HP/Agilent 33120A) can help with that. You can send a burst of sine waves, i.e.: a small number of sine wave cycles, by using internally triggered burst modulation on the HP/Agilent 33120A. This function is not available on the function generators built into the oscilloscope.\nYou can control burst mode by pressing the series of keys shown below. Read the manual for clarification on how these key presses work.\n\nTurn burst modulation mode on: Shift + the ramp/burst button / The text ‘burst’ will be highlighted at the top of the screen.\nTurn burst modulation mode off: Shift + the ramp/burst button / The text ‘burst’ will no longer be highlighted at the top of the screen.\nTurn manual triggering on and internal triggering off: Shift + the TRIG button / The text ‘trig’ will be highlighted at the top of the screen\nTurn manual triggering off and internal triggering on: Shift + the TRIG button / The text ‘trig’ will no longer be highlighted at the top of the screen\nChange the number of cycles sent out in each burst or the burst repetition rate:\nShift + Enter / Screen says “A: Mod Menu,”\nv / Screen says “AM Shape,”\n\n / Screen says \"AM Source,\"\n\n\n / Screen says \"FM Shape,\"\n\n\n / Screen says \"Burst CNT, \"\n\nv / Screen says some number.” OR &gt; / “Burst Rate,” and then V / “some number.”\nEdit the number you see and press enter to save the setting.\n\nSometimes the tank room is noisy. By gathering data that is synchronized with the signal you are sending and averaging over many samples, you can cancel out signals that are not at the same frequency as the burst repetition rate of your signal. This is called coherent averaging. Set this up using the following steps:\n\nUse a second oscilloscope channel to probe the output of your function generator (or attach the trigger output of your function generator to your scope’s trigger input)\nTrigger your oscilloscope on the channel attached to the output of the function generator (or on the trigger input)\nSet your oscilloscope to normal mode acquisition (so that it will only capture a new screen of data when it receives a trigger) and adjust the horizontal position of your oscilloscope trigger so that you don’t waste samples recording data before you send out a burst.\n\nTurn on averaging on your oscilloscope using the Acquisition/Mode button.\n\nYou may refer to this picture of an example range finding setup. It is extremely important that your electronics and the tank water are not mixed, so Use tape to hold electronics down so they can’t fall into the tank, and keep bench top equipment as far from the tank edge as possible. Always dry your test apparatus with a towel as you remove it from the water and be mindful of nearby electrical setups."

This document describes the basics of FMCW processing. You’re on your own for making a triangle wave generator, a voltage controlled oscillator, and the receive mixers.\nYou can use recorded video of your robot, particularly if you have a reference scale in frame, to get a “true”, ground-truth measurement of velocity. VLC works well as capture software for a USB camera, and tripod-stabilized phones also record great video. We recommend tracker for tracking video tracking software.

    "title": "E80 Team Contract",
    "section": "Guidelines for Writing a Team Contract",
    "text": "Guidelines for Writing a Team Contract\nE80 is a team-based class and you will work with other students to complete a collaborative project. To accelerate your team’s development, you will create and sign a team contract as a result of having an engaged conversation in which ALL team members contribute.\nPlease notice that your team contract is a living document which should be re-visited often and updated as necessary.\n\nStages of Team Development\nAccording to concepts from Organizational Behavior, there are five stages of team development:\n\nForming\nStorming\nNorming\nPerforming\nAdjourning\n\nDuring the forming stage, teams tend to communicate in indirect polite ways rather than more directly. The storming stage, characterized by conflict, can be productive, but may consume excessive amounts of time and energy. In this stage it is important to listen well for differing expectations. Next, during the norming stage, teams formulate roles and standards, increasing trust and communication. This norming stage is characterized by agreement on procedures, reduction in role ambiguity, and increased “we-ness” or unity.\nThese developments generally are precursors to the performing stage, during which teams achieve their goals, are highly task oriented, and focus on performance and production. When the task has been completed, the team enters the adjourning phase.\n\n\nTeam Contract Purpose\nTo accelerate a team’s development, a team contract is generated in order to move the team more quickly into the performing stage. This process of generating a team contract can actually help jump-start a group’s collaborative efforts by immediately focusing the team members on a definite task. The group members must communicate and negotiate in order to identify the quality of work they all wish to achieve, and the level of group participation and individual accountability they all feel comfortable with.\nSuccessful team performance depends on personal individual accountability. Conflicts can arise when individualistic motives or behaviors disrupt team-oriented goals. For example, conflict can stem from an unequal division of resources. When team members believe they are receiving too little for what they are giving, they sometimes reduce their effort and turn in work of lower quality. Such “free riding” occurs most frequently when individual contributions are combined into a single product or performance, and individual effort is perceived as unequal. At this point, some individual team members may take on extra responsibilities while other team members may reduce their own efforts or withdraw from the team completely. These behaviors may engender anger, frustration, or isolation—resulting in a dysfunctional team and poor quality of work. However, with a well-formulated team contract, such obstacles can usually be avoided.\nOnce your team contract has been developed, your team is ready to begin work on collaborative assignments. However, you may soon find that your team is not working as well as you had hoped. This is normal but needs to be attended to immediately. Perhaps your team is simply not following the established rules and agreements as strictly as you should be, or perhaps you need to change parts of your contract. Call a team meeting immediately to discuss and resolve the challenges your team is facing; do not delay. Seek guidance from your instructor to resolve any conflicts so that you will have the most positive team experience possible."

Its predecessor E54 - which had more experiments and no field experience - was also offered for more than 20 years. In 2008 the course was revamped to change the field experience to flying fully-instrumented model rockets. In 2017 the course was revamped again with yet another new field experience: deploying fully autonomous underwater robots.\nThe primary purpose of the course is to teach"

You will always turn in assignments on Canvas or complete quizzes/surveys linked from Canvas.\n\n\nSpecifications Grading\nThe grading in E80 for submission sheets and writing assignments is based on whether or not your deliverables meet two different levels of specifications: effort and completion. The overall grade on an assignment is determined by how many of the sections meet either effort or completion.\nEffort specs describe good-faith effort whereas completion specs describe correctness.\nIn most situations, completing all the effort specs is equivalent to a passing grade on the assignment. The remaining sections of completion specs raise your grade from a passing grade to full credit.\nIf the initial version of a submitted assignment does not meet specs, it may be revised according to the stipulations of the course resubmissions policy.\n\n\nGraded Submissions Details\n\nLecture Quizzes\n\nThere are seven video lecture sets that you are expected to watch. Each of these video sets has an associated online quiz. You must take each of these quizzes individually.\nYou may not talk to other people in order to take the quiz, but they are open book, notes and internet. The one exception to the ‘no people’ rule is that you may speak with a professor to clarify ideas before you open the quiz associated with the lecture set.\n\n\n\nSurveys and Team Check-Ins\n\nYou will be called upon to complete surveys at the beginning, middle and end of the class, and each week, you will be asked to complete a team check-in (a quick peer evaluation) for the lab done that week. Completing each of the check-ins is worth 0.5% of your grade, and completing each of the longer surveys is worth 1% of your grade.\nThere are a total of 6 weekly check-ins (from weeks 2 through 7) and they are due each Friday at 3:30 pm.\nThese are individual assignments\n\n\n\nLaboratory Submission Sheets\n\nThere are a total of 8 labs in the class: Lab0 through Lab7. You must submit a submission sheet for each of the labs that contains data you collected during the lab. (Though note that in lab0 the Matlab on-ramp deliverable is the submission sheet.) This submission sheet will be evaluated for correctness: it’s a way of assessing whether your experimental procedure was correct during the lab. Each submission sheet you provide will be worth 4% of your final grade.\nThese are group assignments, so there will be only one submission per team. The Matlab onramp for lab 0 is an exception: it is an individual assignment.\n\n\n\nLaboratory Writing Assignments\n\nYou will be required to complete a writing assignment after labs 1-5. The purpose of the writing assignments is to train you in specific aspects of scientific writing: making figures, using tables, equations, etc. These assignments are completed entirely on Friday in the Writing and Reflection section. Each writing assignment will be worth 3% of your final grade, and you submit five assignments for a total of 15%.\nThese are individual assignments. The team contract exercise in week 0 is an exception, there should be one team contract submission per team.\n\n\n\nTechnical Memorandum\n\nEach student will write an individual technical memorandum on material covered in Lab 6. See the Lab 6 page for more information.\nYou must submit a tech memo to pass the class.\n\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n\nEach team will make a final presentation during Presentation Days, on Wednesday, May 1st, 2024. A detailed schedule will be posted ASAP. The presentation is 15-minutes long followed by a 10-minute Q&A session. The Final Presentation guidelines and rubric are found on the Final Project Report and Presentation page.\n\n\n\nFinal Report\n\nA final technical report will be submitted by each team on the results of the final AUV deployments. The report will be graded for both technical content and proper use of technical English. A rough draft of your final report is due at 11:59 PM on 4/26/24. The final draft is due at 11:59 PM on 5/1/2024. The Final Report guidelines are found on the Final Project page.\n\n\n\nParticipation\n\nThe instructors will assign you a participation grade which is determined by their in-lab observations, your peer evaluations, and your regular progress through the project checkoffs."

    "text": "Pre- and Post-Lab Work Policy\nThe amount of time that you are free to work in lab is restricted. We enforce these restrictions for three main reasons:\n\nto simulate demands that can arise in real-world engineering,\nto help students internalize the learning goals of the class, and\nto help keep E80 to a smaller time footprint.\n\nYou are allowed to work in any way you would like on before a lab (pre-lab) as long as you do not touch any hardware. You may NOT collect data (for your experiment), manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of your lab hours. However, you may look at datasheets, write software, calculate expected results, prepare Excel sheets to do calculations in lab, ask how equipment works, run your preparations by professors, and pursue a variety of other activities. You can spend as much or as little time desired on the pre-lab activities, but successful teams spend a lot of time and energy before the lab starts.\nThe post-lab period is for reflection, resubmission when it’s allowed, and taking a break from E80. You may NOT collect data, manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of lab. However, you may freely reprocess any data that you have already collected during a lab section. This includes, but is not limited to, writing MATLAB code for processing and visualizing your data.\nWhen in doubt about whether an activity is acceptable outside of lab, ask."

To be clear, this means that resubmitted assignments are worth the same amount as initial submission and full credit can be earned even if the initial submission does not fully meet the specifications.\nThe resubmission policy is subject to the stipulations listed below:\n\nYou must submit something by the assignment deadline.\n\nDon’t phone this in because there is limited time for resubmission.\n\nAfter you receive feedback, you can revise your submissions until spring break.\n\nMost of specs can be done outside of lab with data.\nHowever, if you weren’t able to get good data, there is one week before spring break where you can go back to collect more.\n\nResubmissions are checked off by an instructor during office hours.\nFor all submissions, you will need to self-assess before you submit. Every assignment you submit should be accompanied along with a checklist of specs that you believe the assignment meets or does not meet.\nAll resubmissions must be completed by spring break."

In this section, the word group will refer to a full team of students during a normal week or a sub-team of students during weeks where teams are split into sub-teams.\n\nPre-lab: A group may discuss the lab with another group to make sure they are clear on concepts and understanding. Groups may not share code, writing, or documentation with other groups.\nDuring Lab: Groups cannot work together, discuss concepts or understanding, share data, share code, or share writing. Groups may arrange to swap hardware to debug and test defective parts of an experiment or device, but they should strongly consider elevating their concerns to an instructor if part swaps are necessary or if parts are being destroyed.\nPost-Lab: Groups may work with other groups in the same way as the prelab: they may discuss concepts and understanding (including talking about the scale of measured results from lab).\nWriting and Reflection: Each student should be producing an individual work product and may not exchange code or writing with other students. Data may be shared among a group, but not between groups.\n\nThese work restrictions are relaxed during the final project (after spring break): Groups may work on their robot at any time and may discuss any aspect of their robots with one another (as if the prelab policy always applies)."

ALL STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE SATURDAY LAUNCH\nWednesday 2024-05-01 Project presentations for all groups during presentation days.\n\nThe final project for this class is deploying your AUV in open water in order to complete an experiment of your design. This project offers many opportunities for creativity: there are a wide variety of interesting things in the ocean that can be measured. For example, environmental or scientific quantities (e.g., water quality, distribution of temperature, salinity, turbidity) and observation of marine life are good options, as are engineering properties such as sensor accuracy, battery life, sensor or craft mechanical durability, velocity vs. power, controller accuracy, or measuring the structural strains that large motors apply to the robots. Get creative! We look forward to seeing what you come up with.\nThe minimum requirements of the project are as follows:\n\nYour robot must be autonomously deployed to take measurements without human intervention.\nThe deployment must last at least one minute, and the robot must actively control its position during this minute.\nThis deployment must end at a place where the robot can be recovered.\nYour sensor package must be deployed on or from your AUV, either in the water or in the air.\nYour sensor package must use at least three sensors with at least two unique electrical interfaces.\nThe IMU, GPS, and motor current sensors that are already installed on the robot do not count towards this requirement, but they may be used as part of your data collection and analysis.\nAny sensors, including the ones you’ve installed or used as part of any of the labs, are fair game for this project.

    "text": "One-Page Description\nYou must write a one-page description of your project that lays out your scientific and/or engineering goals and describes how your sensor system will help you meet those goals. There are a few specific points that it should address:\n\nIt should answer the question, “Why would anyone do this project?” or “Why should I care about your results?”\nIt should outline your hypothesis and what you’re comparing it to: what is the x of your experiment, what is the y and what two x-y curves are you comparing? If you need to cite literature to establish your scientific relationship, then don’t forget you can access papers through Mudd’s network. Also note that there are lots of websites that can help with figuring out important scientific quantities like wind speed, harbor depth and water temperature, so search carefully to find the expected range of your quantities of interest.\nIt should state the sensors you are using and describe how they relate to your scientific/engineering goals.\nIf should, in text, describe where exceptional mechanical, electrical or software design is required. No need to point out every op-amp, just fancy/abnormal stuff.\nIt should convince the reader that you considered a number of design alternatives when you picked your project. The minimum bar for doing this is including five two-line project descriptions for projects that you considered but did not pursue.\nIt should outline requests for specific launch times or locations for your robot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Locations\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two locations we can launch in Dana Point: the public beach and the Ocean Institute pier. We have a limited number of launch slots on the pier: two teams can launch in each half hour slot from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. If your scientific goals would benefit from a particular launch time slot or slots on the pier, then you should request those slots in this project description. If some time slots are oversubscribed, we will award them randomly. We will prioritize giving every team that wants one a deployment off the pier over giving one team multiple deployments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDana Point Videos\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos have been recorded to give students a sense of the following environment characteristics:\n\nWater outside the harbor. We do not allow you to operate a robot here. Most AUVs will be trashed.\nWorst case currents close to docks. No motors are turned on in this video.\nNormal AUV navigation in the harbor.\nWater clarity."

    "section": "Budget",
    "text": "Budget\nYou must prepare a budget for your final project. You have $50 to spend on the project, and you may not augment that amount with personal money, student project grants or any other source of funds. Your budget only needs to include sensors and other parts (e.g.: motors) that we don’t have in stock, and it should exclude parts that you plan to use from our inventory, which is freely available to you.\nTo capture your budget, prepare a spreadsheet that contains the following for each part you intend to purchase:\n\nPlain English description. e.g.: “Pressure Sensor”.\nPart number. e.g.: “MPX5700”.\nUnit price before tax and shipping.\nTax costs.\nShipping costs. Note that you can defray shipping costs by ordering multiple parts from one vendor.\nLink to vendor site.\nLink to datasheet.\n\nCommon vendors include Digikey, McMaster-Carr, JameCo, SparkFun, AdaFruit and many others.\nCompleting this budget will require you to name specific sensors and mechanical parts and to report their prices. Therefore, you are expected to have selected parts for your experiment before submitting the budget. When you select parts, be sure to qualify them for your mission: do they have the necessary signal input range? an acceptable electrical interface? etc.\nSome of the lab supplies in our inventory, notably speakers and microphones, are not available for permanent installation, but they are available for temporary checkout for prototyping. These supplies are cheap enough that we expect you to buy your own for permanent installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveat emptor! i.e.: Let the Buyer Beware\n\n\n\n\nSurface mounted (SMT) parts are generally hard for students to work with. You need to buy an adapter board for your part if you are buying something surface mounted.\nIf you use a part with a digital interface, be careful of I2C, UART and SPI. Using any of these will require a bigger software effort than sampling an analog signal.\nWe have found that off the shelf ultrasound transducers don’t perform well underwater. Though it’s hard, it’s better to build your own out of our parts.\n\n\n\nOnce you have prepared your budget, you must check it off and then submit a purchase order:\n\nGet necessary approvals:\n\nAll purchases must be approved by your section instructor, who will initial your purchase requests on the tracking spreadsheet.\nAll purchases must be approved by a second instructor, who will also initial your purchase request on the tracking spreadsheet.\nYou must ensure that the professors record your designated buyer; the ONE person on your team who is allowed to submit purchase orders.\nYou will not be approved if your order is over $50. DO NOT FORGET TAXES AND SHIPPING when preparing your budget.\n\nPrepare a purchase order:\n\nNew Purchase Order Request Form\nArrange for purchases to be shipped to the Engineering Department.\nInclude your team number and section number in a description field.\nList Prof. Brake as the professor to approve the purchase request.\n\n\nPurchases have a relatively long lead time, around a week. However, if your proposal is approved before spring break, then that lead time will be hidden by the break."

Therefore, please sketch these drawings (either by hand or in a drawing program) and please DO NOT provide a SolidWorks model.\nYour mechanical drawings should allow a professor to evaluate important design decisions. Therefore, do the following:\n\nIndicate motor locations. Careful to keep them as far from your IMU as possible to keep the magnetometer happy.\nIndicate sensor locations.\nIndicate penetrator locations and note the number of wires passing through each penetrator.\nSketch the wiring harness and how it’s fastened to the robot.\nInclude approximate calculations of mass, center of gravity, buoyancy, center of pressure, and (if necessary) ballast.\nIf you’re doing something bold, calculate the required torque for your motors. Motor datasheets can help.\nInclude a brief paragraph summarizing major design decisions. e.g.: “It’s flat and wide because we wanted a raft.”"

Your schematic should be a comprehensive design document, so do the following:\n\nShow every wire, resistor, capacitor (don’t forget bypass capacitors), and power source (i.e.: battery) that you intend to assemble into your final design.\n\nAnnotate the expected Voltage swing on every node of the schematic.\nCheck that none of the Teensy pin nodes swing above 3.3 V or below 0 V.\nWhere appropriate, include relevant reference designs from datasheets (with citation) to justify your schematic choices.\nThough we’re not requiring simulations of your design here, having a working simulation of the design is a great idea.\nSplit this big schematic into multiple smaller ones if it makes it easier to read. (It may still make sense to submit one big schematic, but consider whether a big schematic or several small ones will serve you better.)\n\nAll of your new electronics will be assembled on a new board called the protoboard. We discuss the protoboard in greater detail during the project build, but its limited size should inform your circuit design. The protoboard has the same number of rows as a standard breadboard, so don’t pick designs that require more wires than would fit on a breadboard. As a reminder, you can find the design details for all the PCBs you will use on the boards page, and those design details can help when planning out your final project."

    "title": "E80 Project Field Deployments",
    "section": "Best Practices",
    "text": "Best Practices\nDeploying a robot is complicated business, and it’s easy to make a mistake. Following the best practices described in this section reduce the chance that you’ll make a mistake and increase the chances that you’ll get good data.\nSafety Lines If your robot is diving, tie a string to it before you deploy it. Keep the string slack during deployment if things are going well, or use it to pull the robot to safety if things are going poorly.\nBoat Escorts If your robot is unreachable from shore, which is common when surface navigating, then keeping a boat nearby is a good way to ensure that your robot can be recovered in case it does anything unsafe or risks damage to itself.\nCalibrations Some sensors need to be recalibrated on site. Notably, magnetometer coefficients vary with your declination from the pole, and atmospheric pressure varies with your distance from sea level. You may also need to tune the range on light or temperature sensors to account for local brightness or water temperature. Be ready to do some basic calibrations on site, and be sure to do some test runs to make sure that your sensor outputs are in range before committing to a major deployment.\nGround Truth: You should take a ground truth measurement before each deployment so that you know the basic conditions your robot will deploy into. For instance, you could measure water temperature with a digital thermometer before putting your temperature-measuring robot in the water. This is essential for detecting bugs in your sensors or calibration: if you only have your robot data to work with, and your robot data is flawed, it’s difficult to back out what went wrong (or even detect that something went wrong).\nSave your Data: Field data is precious, even if it looks bad. Make sure to save it! Save all of your data, and don’t leave it on the SD card to get accidentally deleted. It is helpful to have a folder where you can store all your data for each deployment, and to keep a spreadsheet in that folder so you can make notes about each file (when it was run, deployment location, notes on anything weird that happened, etc.).\nPreview your Data: After you deploy your robot, you should check your data to see if it matches your ground truth and your expected behavior. To do this, you should have some Matlab or other visualization software ready before deployment. This step is important because it tells you if your deployment worked properly while you still have time to redeploy.\nExperimental Plan Most of the advice above is concerned with an individual deployment, but you should also be thinking holistically about your experimental goals while deploying. How many deployments do you need, from what locations, and at what times of day? The experimental plan is the place to write down these details. The plan should also list the expected range of signals you expect to observe (based on theory or preliminary measurements) during the deployments. Finally, in the case of surface navigation, the plan should show the intended robot trajectory for each deployment and list how the robot will be recovered (kayak, it comes back and we grab it, pool hook, etc.).\nChecklist: Most of the advice in this section is gives you more work to do before you launch. It’s very easy to forget a step and launch in a way that corrupts your data. The surest proof against such a mistake is writing a deployment checklist that spells out all the steps you should do before a launch. Use the checklist during a launch by having one team member read steps off of it while another works on the robot and verifies that steps are complete. Here is an example deployment checklist.\nThere are some additional practices that will help when you prepare specifically for deploying at Dana Point:\nBuoyancy: Seawater and lake water have very different densities. A neutrally buoyant AUV in pHake Lake will bob like a cork in the ocean. Be ready to trim your ballast appropriately.\nElectrical Coupling: Salt water and fresh water have very different conductivities, and that can affect the performance of your sensors in surprising ways. One thing we’ve noticed is that motor noise couples into sensors much more aggressively in salt water than in fresh water. Test this behavior in the salt water bath at Mudd, and consider stopping your motors during your deployment to take clean data. (This is easier in surface deployments than in dives because you need to maintain your depth during a dive.)"

The main body should be logically organized and should discuss every topic from the following list that is relevant to the robot’s mission.\n\n2.1 Scientific and/or Engineering Goals\nAn explanation of the specific phenomena the robot was designed to measure, why these measurements are important, and what can be learned from these measurements. A similar explanation should accompany each goal.\n\n5 – As above. Theory of each goal articulated quantitatively with analysis of confounding factors. Similar depth for each goal.\n4 – Basic theory present for all goals but either not articulated quantitatively or missing confounding factors.\n3 – Missing information on one goal. Partial information on multiple goals. Basic theory present but lacks quantitative rigor and analysis of confounding factors\n2 – Basic theory not well articulated or incorrect for multiple goals.\n1 – Hard to interpret. Goals missing.\n\n\n\n2.2 Sensor Selection\nA discussion of what sensors were chosen and how they relate to the scientific or engineering goals. The discussion should address the sensor input/excitation range and how these compare with the expected excitation during deployment. The discussion should also address the output range and or form (voltage, AC voltage or pulse train, pulse width modulated, pulse height modulated, etc.), and impedance. A similar analysis should accompany each sensor.\n\n5 – As above. Expected input limits articulated quantitatively and backed with analysis/simulation. Comparison of input limit to datasheet spec. Discussion of output range and time constant for each sensor.\n4 – Missing input limits, output scale or time constant for a small fraction of sensors.\n3 – Missing one of input limits, output scale, or time constant from most sensors or 2 of 3 for a small number of them.\n2 – Missing two of input limits, output scale or time constant from most sensors.\n1 – Analysis fundamentally wrong or missing.\n\n\n\n2.3 Circuit and Robot Design\nAn explanation of the circuits that were designed. This should include discussion of the component values which were selected or calculated e.g.: to get the expected variations in output into the 0-to-3.3V input range of the Teensy. This should explain if the sample rate of 10 Hz was sufficient. This should also explain modifications to the robot which were made to ensure the sensor functioned properly (these may be in a separate mechanical design section). A similar explanation should accompany each sensor.\n\n5 – As above. Circuit topology, gain and signal conditioning discussed for each sensor. Power supplies and their uses enumerated. Mechanical modifications considered and well described.\n4 – Purpose of some circuits is unclear. Omit description of some signal conditioning circuitry or decisions for calculating gain. Power supplies introduced without their uses. Missing schematics. Mechanical mounting omitted for some sensors or not in sufficient depth.\n3 – Purpose of some circuits is very unclear. Description of most signal conditioning circuitry limited to discussion only topology with no reference to signal conditioning or gain. Power supplies ignored. Mechanical mounting is very weak.\n2 – Most circuits are very unclear. Signal conditioning circuits mentioned only trivially. Mechanical mounting not described.\n1 – Design details fundamentally wrong or missing.\n\n\n\n2.4 Modeling\nAn explanation of how MATLAB, historical data, or your own models were used to predict the robot’s performance, the sensor measurements versus time, and how the modeling results informed the experimental protocol. There should be a similar analysis for each sensor.\n\n5 – As above. Simulations or analytical models pursued, relevant data extracted for each sensor and control algorithm and modifications described and linked to simulation.\n4 – Simulation or models present, relevant data extracted for multiple sensors / control algorithms.\n3 – Simulation or models present, any relevant data extracted.\n2 – Simulation or models present but very little relevant data is extracted.\n1 – Simulations or models fundamentally wrong or missing.\n\n\n\n2.5 Experimental Procedure\nAn explanation of the experimental protocol. e.g., The goals for each deployment, prepping the robot, starting the teensy code, deployment details, recovery details, retrieval of the data, and processing of the data.\n\n5 – Reasonable description of launch procedure. Some team specific details.\n3 – Poor description of launch procedure. Or generic / low effort regurgitation of checklist\n1 – Missing or very bad.\n\n\n\n2.6 Includes Required Sections\n\n1 - Includes discussion of employment safety\n0 - Does not include discussion of deployment safety\n\n\n\n2.7 Comparison of Data to Model\nA comparison of the modeled (or expected) data from 3.D with the retrieved data from 3.E. Graphical comparison is preferred, but written comparison should be used as appropriate, especially to explain the graphical data. Error bars or estimates should be included in all experimental quantities. Whether each deployment is compared individually or all deployments compared together will depend on the data sets and the results. Descriptions of the degree of agreement should be made and possible explanations of the discrepancies should be present.\n\n5 – Well thought out graphical comparisons between simulated, analytical and experimental results. Appropriate explanations in text. Error bars used carefully. Analyze agreement with hypotheses.\n4 – Reasonable data organization and graphics. Some evidence of margining deployment and model data into easily digestible formats. Some reasonable conclusions drawn about the comparison between deployment and model.\n3 – Poor data organization (eg: copied and pasted MATLAB plots split over several figures) but a present and meaningful comparison of modeled data vs. deployment data.\n2 – Poor data organization and poor analysis of results. Not well compared between model and flight, but some evidence of an attempt at comparison.\n1 – Missing or very bad."

    "text": "On Giving Feedback\n\nFocus on the big stuff.: Is the main claim clear? Is their sufficient evidence to support it? Are the ideas explained well? Are paragraphs focused on just a single idea? Where can the data be presented more clearly?\nTrust your gut. If something feels wrong to you as a reader, it probably can be improved. Do your best to explain why you feel something could be improved and give a suggestion on how to improve it.\nPraise what works well. When something is done well, say so!\nGive kind and honest feedback for improvement. Writing is a never-ending process of revision. There is always something to be improved. Your peer’s work almost certainly could benefit from some revision so be polite and direct about how you think the work could be improved.\nGive thoughtful comments. Try to be as specific in your comments as you can. If possible, explain what you sense is wrong and suggest how it could be changed. If possible, ask questions for the author to consider before they would revise.\nStep back. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the minutia while we read. Make sure to step back at the end to see how the report fits together as a whole."

    "text": "On Getting Feedback\n\nAppreciate the gift you’ve been given. Someone took the time to read your writing. This is truly a gift! You are being called to improve your work because it has value and because your project is worth making clearer and better. By listening to your peers, you save yourself a great deal of stress and work: they are telling you what is and isn’t coming across clearly so you can revise effectively.\nRemember: clarity is in the eye of the reader, not the writer. In large part, your audience is the best judge of your work. You’re likely too close to your ideas and intentions to see if they are best captured in your writing.\nYou needn’t “defend” your work. We can generally assume that you, the author, didn’t intend for things to be unclear. And we can assume that your peer reviewer is trying to identify lack of clarity, not request an explanation of your specific thought processes as you wrote. Therefore, it isn’t really that helpful to explain away to your peer why you wrote what you wrote unless they ask for such an explanation. Instead, you want to focus on how you can clarify things—e.g., “Would it be clearer if I did x instead of y?”\nConsider each comment, but you needn’t revise on behalf of each. If your peers say something could use improvement, please take their comments seriously. Upon reflection, though, you might think it best not to make changes. Perhaps you have good reasons for what you have written; perhaps other revisions will clear up the issue in question.\nAsk for clarification on comments you receive.\nIf possible, chat with the people who gave you feedback to learn more about their comments and how you might improve your work.\nAcknowledge people who give you feedback. It’s good practice to keep track of everyone who helped you in your project and to construct an acknowledgments page as part of your manuscript.\n\nTry to revise while comments are fresh; don’t forget to look for that small stuff once everything else is in order. Carve out time to make some notes on how you will revise. When revision is done, proofread your work. And again."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this lab you will take measurements of objects in a wind tunnel, then simulate the wind tunnel experiments using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This exercise will help you learn about fluid dynamics concepts, provide some possibilities for fluids-related final projects, and help you think about the how simulation, analysis and measurement work together. Simulation, hand analysis and measurement are tools that engineers can use to show that they are correct, and seeking agreement between the three (and knowing when to distrust one or the other) is an essential skill in every engineering discipline.\nAfter successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate safe start-up and shut-down sequence for the wind tunnel.\nDetermine wind speeds in the wind tunnel using a Pitot tube and digital manometer.\nMeasure drag forces on various shapes in the wind tunnel at various flow velocities.\nUtilize COMSOL computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model the drag and lift forces of the objects tested in the wind tunnel.\nCompare the results obtained in the wind tunnel to those predicted by COMSOL.\nUse COMSOL to create, simulate, and predict the lift and drag characteristics of wing-like objects.\n\nThis lab will take place in the Engineering Computing Facility (ECF) in Parsons B178 and the wind tunnel room. E80 students should already have card access to Parsons B178. If you cannot access the room, please contact the Engineering Department Office.\nYou will be using COMSOL Multiphysics software in this lab. COMSOL is complicated software, and you will struggle to finish the lab if you do not read about its use and practiced with it during prelab. Here are the prelab rules for COMSOL:\n\nYou may practice using COMSOL and go through Granny Spark’s COMSOL tutorials as part of prelab.\nYou may not run COMSOL simulations on lab-related objects outside of your designated lab time. These objects include the cylindrical objects tested in the wind tunnel, the “flat plate wing” and the NACA 6412 wing.\nYou may not use COMSOL during any other section’s lab time slot because that can deprive students in lab of COMSOL licenses.\n\nEach team will have exactly 60 minutes to use the wind tunnel to run experiments and collect data. The order that teams are sent to the wind tunnel is random and determined at the start of the section, so be ready to go first!\nThis is a rotation lab, so not all teams will be working on this lab in the same week. Even numbered teams (12, 24, 36, etc.) will do this lab in week 6, while Odd numbered teams (12, 24, 36, etc.) work on Lab 5. Odd numbered teams will do this lab in week 7, while Even numbered teams work on lab 5. Be sure to watch the correct videos, do the correct quiz, and put in prelab effort for the correct lab!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSafety Tips for the Wind Tunnel\n\nFollow the dress code for E80 Lab.\n\nEveryone must wear safety goggles during the test. Hearing protection will be provided if needed.\nOnly turn the fan on after checking that there are no loose objects in the test chamber and the test chamber cover plate is secure.\nEnsure that all test personnel are at a safe distance from the wind tunnel itself (at least 24” in any direction).\nMake sure the article under test is securely fastened inside the test chamber.\nNever run the wind tunnel without a proctor or professor present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrelab resources on fluids, aerodynamics, and COMSOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA Beginner’s Guide to Aerodynamics (click here)\nE80 fluid measurements lecture notes (click here)\nAirfoil database (click here)\nAirfoil and angle of attack definitions (click here)\nNASA Wing geometry definitions (click here)\nNASA Reynolds Number guide (click here)\nGrandma Spark’s step-by-step video guide to using COMSOL to model a cylinder in laminar flow (105 MB PowerPoint File, click here).

    "text": "2 Wind Tunnel Experiments\nIn this section you get a chance to operate Harvey Mudd’s wind tunnel! Pay attention to the wind tunnel safety tips in the introduction. Your team will have exactly 60 minutes to complete this section.\n\n2.1 Getting to Know Your Wind Tunnel\nIn this sub-section, you will familiarize yourself with the wind tunnel. Do the following after a professor or proctor shows you the wind tunnel room.\n\nLocate the important pieces of wind tunnel control and measurement technology items shown in Figure 1.\nEnsure that the LVDT box is turned on. If it is not, the switch is on the right side of the box in the rear. DO NOT TOUCH THE KNOBS ON THE FRONT OF THIS BOX.\n\nSafely open the test chamber: Ensure that the fan is not running in the wind tunnel by pushing the “STOP” button on the RPM controller, then Open the wind tunnel test chamber by removing the four clamps and gently removing the window.\nVerify that there is nothing but a Pitot tube (which looks like this) and the force measurement stand in the wind tunnel. If there are other objects in the wind tunnel, remove them.\nObserve the mounting of the Pitot tube in the wind tunnel. Ensure that the end of the tube is properly oriented directly facing the incoming airflow. Ensure that the pitot probe is connected to the digital manometer.\nTurn on the digital manometer. Zero it.\nTest the LVDT by doing the following while observing lift and drag force readouts:\n\nGENTLY push on the left side of the force measurement stand with one finger.\nGENTLY push on the right side of the force measurement stand with one finger.\nGENTLY push on the top of the force measurement stand with one finger.\nGENTLY pull on the top side of the force measurement stand with two fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRPM Controller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFan Speed Display\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLVDT Readout Above Test Chamber\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wind tunnel control and measurement boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Wind-Speed to Fan Speed Calibration Curve\nIn this subsection you will create a calibration curve that relates airspeed in the wind tunnel to fan RPM.\n\nPerform safety checks for wind tunnel startup:\n\nis the window on the test section clamped securely at four corners?\nis everyone wearing safety goggles?\nis the test chamber free of loose debris?\n\nPower up the wind tunnel by pushing the green button labeled “START” on the gray box.\nAdjust the fan speed with the knob on the RPM Controller while reading the RPM from the Fan Speed Display. Adjust the fan speed from 15% to 55% of max fan speed (in increments of 5%). At each fan speed:\n\nMeasure the airspeed\nRecord the lift and drag forces exhibited by the force measurement stand at each RPM setting. These values represent a the lift and drag of the test apparatus, and should be subtracted from the measured lift and drag in future tests.\n\nZero the speed in the wind tunnel and push the red button labeled “STOP” on the gray box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo increase the accuracy of your wind speed measurements, allow time at each measurement for the wind tunnel to come to steady state. Also, repeat measurements with increasing and decreasing RPM to ensure reproducible results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo calculate air velocity, you can use\n\nthis Excel spreadsheet PitotVelocityCalculator\nthis Google Sheet,\n\nthe Dwyer Air Velocity Calculator\nthe Dwyer Air Velocity Calculation Card that has been placed next to the wind tunnel.\n\nUsing these tools or the card requires that you know:\n\nThe ambient (room) temperature. Read the temperature sensor in the room.\nThe relative humidity. Read the humidity sensor in the room.\nThe absolute air pressure. Use a barometric pressure app on a cell phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Measuring the Drag Forces on Cylindrical Objects\n\nSafely open the test chamber using the same steps as instruction 3 in Section 2.1.\nMount the cylindrical fixture on the force measurement stand and ensure that it is horizontal. Make sure that the side of the cylinder that says “FRONT TOWARDS FLOW” is facing the incoming flow.\nFor each of “Nose #1”, “Nose #2” and “Nose #3”\n\nInstall the nose on the cylinder. PLEASE BE GENTLE! You can break the force measurement stand. Ask for help if you think you are pushing hard.\nSafely power up the wind tunnel by performing the same checks as instruction 1 in Section 2.2.\nRecord values for lift and drag shown on the LVDT box at zero flow velocity. These are instrument offsets that must be subtracted from your future measurements.\nMeasure the drag force on the object from 15% to 55% of max fan speed (in increments of 5%).\n\nBring the flow back down to zero and press the red “STOP” button.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Measuring the Drag Forces on a Scale Robot Model\n\nSafely open the test chamber using the same steps as instruction 3 in Section 2.1.\nMount the 1/3 scale model of the robot in the wind tunnel chamber using a zip tie as shown in Figure 2. Pay attention to its orientation.\n\nSafely power up the wind tunnel by performing the same checks as instruction 1 in Section 2.2.\nRecord necessary calibration information, then record drag force on the object from 15%-55% of max fan speed (in increments of 5%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mounting the scaled model of the robot in the test chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Plot Results\n\nReturn to Parsons B178\nPlot a calibration curve of airspeed in the test section versus RPM. Perform the necessary regression analysis and display the appropriate error bars.\nFor each nose and the scale robot model:\n\nPlot a curve of drag force vs. Reynolds number\nPlot a curve of drag coefficient vs. Reynolds number using appropriate characteristic lengths and reference areas."

You will be mounting your AUV’s motors in the same manner as the three motor assembly in Practicum 1A Section 4.7.\nConstruct at least one additional motor from scratch. Reference Practicum 1A Section 4.2 for assembly instructions. Each team will be provided with 2 used motors, but needs to make a third, and may make more to have backups.\nTest that all three of your motors pull less than 500 mA. To do this, supply 6 V to the motor using a power supply.\nMount the motors on the new frame."

So please place a resistor in series with your LED, and calculate an appropriate resistance value using this formula:\n\\[R=\\frac{(V_s-V_F)}{I_F}\\]\nwhere \\(V_S\\) is the supply voltage, and \\(V_F\\) and \\(I_F\\) are the foward voltage and current of the diode respectively. \\(V_F\\) and \\(I_F\\) can be found on LED datasheet.\nBreadboard Internals.\nHow to build a 555 Timer circuit.

Note that Teensys are in limited supply, so practice soldering before checking this out.\nOne team member should solder header pins to the Teensy. Use the reference images below as a guide, and make sure your pins are oriented as indicated in the references before you solder.\n\nRemember to:\n\nNever leave your soldering iron unattended.\nTurn the iron off any time it isn’t used for more than 30 seconds. A good rule of thumb is “The iron is off unless you are holding it right now.”\nUse recently soaked sponge. Use a spray bottle to moisten. Never use the sink or water fountain.\nUse fume extractor: fumes from rosin in solder is a respiratory irritant.\nWash hands after handling solder – solder is 40% lead. Skin contact is harmless, but ingestion can occur with unwashed hands when eating, drinking, or smoking.\nAlways tin the tip of your iron before turning it off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Unsoldered Teensy and strip of header pins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Soldered Teensy 4.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reference diagrams for Teensy assembly."

First, we need the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE). An integrated development environment (IDE) is a program that makes writing software easier, and we’ll use the Arduino IDE to program our Teensys. Second, we need version control software so we can keep your code up to date. Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to download a local copy of all the E80 software. It also allows you to easily track the changes that you make to your code. While we won’t be using all the features of git in E80, we will introduce you to the main features that will enable you to interact with the code base for your robot.\nFollow the setup instructions at bottom of the E80 Github page. After completing these instructions you should have a folder on your computer with all the E80 starter source code for the semester and have the Arduino IDE set up to easily access and load the provided sketchbooks."

For this lab, the figures must include an electrical schematic of the voltage divider circuit and clearly show where the measurement was made. The figure should have a descriptive caption and follow the best practices outlined in the Lab 1 writing assignment. Your figure should include 150-250 word section of text describing the schematic and explaining how the measurement was made.\nThe results section should present the data you collected. For this lab, the results section will be tables presenting the measured and predicted output voltage values. You should present one table which demonstrates the impact of measuring different resistance values with the same instrument (e.g., the multimeter). Another table should contains data to demonstrate the influence of different measurement devices used on the same circuit (e.g., comparing data from a set value of Z1 and Z2 across the multimeter, both oscilloscope probes, and Teensy) The predicted values should be calculated using the appropriate model for the electrical measurement tools you used and the appropriate error bounds (i.e., your model should include the internal resistance of any measurement tool and the resultant loading effects.) A 100-150 word section of text should be included beneath each table describing the results and what they mean, along with noting any particular notable features or discrepancies (e.g., if the measured value is outside of the 95% confidence interval).\nAs usual in E80 writing assignments, these sections are going to be presented without an introduction, and therefore you need to exercise some caution in topic sentences to provide the barest introduction to the material. For example, don’t lead by writing “The robot navigated the course”. Instead, write “This data describes a robot navigating an obstacle course in an underwater test tank.”"

    "text": "Statement of Work\nPrepare high-quality electrical schematics and a mechanical drawing to include in a methods section of a technical memo describing the operation of the turbidity meter you built in Lab 3. You should include a schematic for your 555 timer circuit and your transimpedance amplifier. The accompanying text should describe how the circuit and cuvette holder are used to build the turbidity meter.\nAn electrical schematic describes the functional connection of the components in an electrical circuit. It does not directly represent the physical layout of the circuit in 3d-space on a breadboard or printed circuit board. However, there are certain conventions you should follow when drawing your schematic to allow it to be easily read and understood. These are detailed in the lab submission sheet and the specs below.\nFor this assignment, draw schematics for the 555 timer circuit and the transimpedance amplifier you developed for your turbidity meter. Ensure your schematics follow all the proper conventions as detailed in the specs below and in the lab manual. After each schematic, include a 100-150 word section of text to describe its design and operation.\nThe mechanical drawing for this lab is a three-dimensional view of the 3d-printed cuvette holder for the turbidity meter. Your drawing should convey to the reader the key features of the design along with the most important dimensions needed to understand the scale of the design. It does not need to include all the relevant dimensions in order to manufacture the part. The function of the diagram for the written assignment is to communicate how it is used in the experiment. Include a 100-150 word section of text to describe how the cuvette holder is used in the turbidity meter."

Temperature and pressure have been called the “monarchs of measurements” by some Mudd professors because of their wide applicability in chemical and industrial processes, aerospace applications, and natural sciences (including oceanography), which is why we are working with these measurements this week. You might find some time in this lab to prepare a resubmission, possibly by revisiting data from labs 1-3.\nAfter successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:\n\nRelate the resistance of a thermistor to its temperature using the Steinhart-Hart Equation.\nPerform a fit to a non-linear function of data\nUse NIST tables to interpret thermocouple Voltages\nUse a multimeter to measure temperature with a thermocouple\nDescribe the basics of cold junction compensation\nComment on the relative speed of solid-state linear temperature sensors, thermistors and thermocouples.\n\nThis lab will be carried out as sub-teams of two. Policies for sub-teams are discussed in Lab 2.\nIT IS YOUR TEAM’S RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING ICE TO LAB. THIS IS PART OF YOUR PRELAB! Hot water will be available from the water heater in the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that water is an electrical conductor and putting an electronic component that is not waterproofed into water carries some risk.

Determine safety protocols for working with hot water to avoid spilling it or inadvertently touching it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe only constant-temperature bath in the lab is the 25 °C bath in the E80 lab (B171).

However, that range of output voltages is small compared to the input range of the Teensy, so if you want to use this sensor in your final project, you will get large errors from Teensy quantization unless you build an amplifier. In this section, you will design an op-amp circuit that shifts and scales MPX5700 output Voltage range into the Teensy input range, which is approximately 0 V to 3.3 V. Use the MCP601 op-amp and Vdd = 5 V.\n\nFind the Voltages the MPX5700 will produce when at depths between 0 m and 40 cm. Recall that the sensor will experience atmospheric pressure at 0m. We will call this Voltage range the target Voltage range.\nDesign an op-amp circuit that will shift and scale MPX5700 output Voltages from the target voltage range to a new Voltage range that is suitable for reading by the Teensy. The new Voltage range should have a maximum of 3.0 V and a minimum of 0.3 V.\nBuild the op-amp circuit and test it with a function generator to convince yourself it is working.\nBuild an MPX5700 on your breadboard, and test that it works using a multimeter and a water column in a graduated cylinder.

    "text": "3 Build a Thermistor Interface Circuit\nIn another echo of E79, this section is about building a thermistor-based temperature sensor. The sensor will consist of a resistor/thermistor divider circuit and an op-amp circuit. The op-amp circuit will shift and scale the divider circuit’s output Voltage range to better match the Teensy’s input Voltage range. The thermistor you will use is a Murata NXFT15WB473FA2B150. You will need to predict the resistance as a function of temperature, and the formula you will use here shown in Equation 1 where \\(R\\) is the current resistance of the thermistor at temperature \\(T\\) in Kelvins, \\(R_0\\) is the known resistance at reference temperature \\(T_0\\) in Kelvins, and \\(B\\) is a constant in the datasheet.\n\\[ R=R_0 \\exp{\\left(B(1/T-1/T_0)\\right)}  \\tag{1}\\]\n\nPredict the resistance you will see from the thermistor when it is in a 0 °C bath to a 20 °C bath.\nDesign a Voltage divider that converts the thermistor resistance to Voltage. The divider should use a supply Voltage of 5V, a thermistor in the top position, and a resistor of your choice in the bottom position. Predict the output Voltages of this circuit when the thermistor is in a 0 °C bath to a 20 °C bath. Use appropriate measures of uncertainty.\nDesign an op-amp circuit using one or more op-amps that will shift and scale the output of the thermistor divider into the Teensy Voltage range (0.3V to 3.0V). Use single-rail op-amps with a supply Voltage of 5V. Note that you need to be careful of loading in this circuit because op-amp circuits can load sensors just like the instruments in lab 2. Think carefully whether adding a second op-amp can improve your results.\nBuild the divider and op-amp circuits, test them individually, hook them together, then test the combination using a 0 °C bath and a 20 °C bath and compare results to predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Thermistor Equation Background\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Thermistor wikipedia page or the Steinhart-Hart Equation Wikipedia page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to the Thermistor\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to do this lab by just connecting to thermistor leads using BNC-hook connections. However, this might be mechanically touchy in some situations, and you might find the thermistor wires to be short. You have the option of adding leads to your thermistor temperature probe using the instructions from E79 in section 3. You DO NOT need to make a whole umbilical. You only need to make the temperature sensor. You will certainly need to extend thermistor leads if you choose to use a thermistor in your final project."

You will measure the resistance of a thermistor directly with a multimeter in this section so that you can focus on the resistance-temperature behavior, modeling and non-linear fitting.\nAnother equation that relates thermistor resistance and temperature, the Steinhart-Hart Equation, is relevant in this section. The equation is shown in Equation 2, and in this equation, \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, \\(R\\) is the resistance of the thermistor, and \\(A_1\\), \\(B_1\\), \\(C_1\\) and \\(D_1\\) are fitting coefficients called Steinhart-Hart coefficients. Note that the \\(B_1\\) variable in Equation 2 is different than the \\(B\\) variable in Equation 1.\n\\[ 1/T = A_1 + B_1 \\ln R + C_1 \\ln^2 R + D_1 \\ln^3 R  \\tag{2}\\]\n\nUse the multimeter to measure the resistance of a thermistor at room temperature. While still measuring the resistance, hold the thermistor tightly with your fingers and verify that the multimeter reading changes.\nObtain a digital thermometer to use for “ground truth” temperature measurements.\nPrepare a set of eight different temperature baths between 0 °C and 80 °C. You will only have access to a few insulated beakers to prepare these baths, so you may need to prepare them in batches or wait for the first baths you made to cool a bit in order to get extra data points.\nUse the multimeter and the digital thermometer to measure the temperatures of your baths and the resistance of the thermistor when it is submerged in each bath.\nUse fitting techniques to extract the Steinhart-Hart coefficients for your thermistor with appropriate measures of uncertainty. Don’t forget about the Steinhart-Hart fitting example on the lectures page.\nPlot the data points, the Steinhart-Hart fit, and the fit provided by datasheet parameters and Equation 1 on the same axes.\nPlot the residuals of your fit."

Thermocouples are extremely common temperature probes that have huge ranges and fast response times. We don’t see many thermocouples on E80 final projects (you could change that!) because they have complicated interface requirements, but they’re such important sensors that we want to spend some time working with them in lab. As in Section 4, we’ll use the multimeter to measure properties here so that we can focus on the sensor itself. As a reminder, we use the Greenlee DM-210A Digital Multimeter, and you may need to review the datasheet to understand how to take temperature measurements with the thermocouple. You’ll need the NIST tables to decode your thermocouple Voltages.\n\nObtain a type-K thermocouple from the instructors. Be sure to return it at the end of lab!\nObtain a digital thermometer to use for “ground truth” temperature measurements.\nPrepare a set of five different temperature baths between 0 °C and 80 °C.
